I see steam billowing from a kettle, hear a screech. someone coaxing her to a tap. but the writing is bold, she’d live alone. no rings, not fuss, get the first-aid kit. she’s counting, fingers perfect as piano keys. what does she do? can’t be much, jeans, scuffed burgundy ballet shoes. crosses legs, fake tan. deep in thought, jots down a word or two. checks phone, applies scarlet lipstick (using phone for a mirror). stands, is tall. reminds me of a suffragette, must be the black velvet jacket. alights from train, melts into crowd",

    "text": "The suffering has ended. Empty your eyes, a new era begins. Heads, once out of line, have fallen. People call from windows. Surrounded by laughter becoming noise, others call up to the windows. Animals never seen before come out from the alleys. There are broad-faced women with broad accents walking pavements, talking freely, their faces lit up, their hair undone. Sunlight, trumpets, and pianos are playing boogie. Emboldened, people smile in public places. The intact houses blink, doors swing open and somehow smile back to other houses. The banal parade floats above the ash of iron filings. A mother with a blue apron that frames her baby cheers at random, another child by her side trembles, astonished and fearful. There’s an apparition of an angel, timid and adrift in the midst of life, while rustling people gather in the square. Foreigners pass by in a group, singing under bright umbrellas, their lyrics sleek and empty. A grandfather goes about extinguishing street lamps against the coming radiance. A jazz dancer leaps out from her suitcase with an answer nobody can understand. A policeman rides his one-wheeled bike, his thighs swollen against black leggings. He circles the stragglers, until a spotlight picks up his problem. The circus of shadows moves through the jumping city as rackets break their own strings. On the far ramparts, a boy with a thousand dreams cries because he feels he is ugly.",

    "text": "It was never a question of beauty but something else. Mind for example. For a long time you had no dress of your own, except those your mother had her servant make. Dô could sew with hair-fine needles, pleats and Peter Pan collars. She could make anything look timeless. Writing was sewing. Writing was taking an image—a ferry crossing the Mekong say, and empty it of all significance until it became transcendent, a Godly idea, an image all had forgotten. That never existed. ‘The Mekong—that blood in the body, that slow flow between banks that had faded away. The river carries everything along, straw huts, forests, burnt-out fires, dead birds, dead dogs, drowned tigers and buffaloes, drowned men, bait, islands of water hyacinths all stuck together. Everything flows towards the Pacific, no time for anything to sink, all is swept along by the deep and headlong storm of the inner current, suspended on the surface of the river’s strength.’ History again, locked in the depths of your flesh. And like a new-born child, it was blind, or so it seemed to the ungainly, the women from elsewhere, the mothers and the sons, ‘mute and cowed in the presence of the father.’ And it was blind.",

And when you asked me if I was Emily Dickinson’s ear I nodded. Solitary. Solitaire. Solipsist. ‘For whom does the bell toll?’ you asked that afternoon. Campanologists? Two in Campagna? Campaniles? ‘It tolls for thee.’ R.I.P. my lover. R.I.P. my van winkle. Rip out my heart. Wrap it in your white t-shirt and bury it beneath your floorboards. Still beating. My little drummer boy. You can beat me but I won’t be your fiendish queen, my butcher. My blood on your t-shirt will form a scarlet letter. Spot Out damn spot! You wore a white t-shirt to bed last night when all I wanted was to be stuck to your back. When all I asked was to peel myself off you in the morning and mount your erect compass needle. But now we are done. Donne. And you peel me like a grape. I slither out of my skin. Skinner. Skin me alive. I thought we were conjoined. Destined to travel in circles until we met again, in the middle. Until we found our core. But like Nabokov’s apples, all you manage to achieve is to tempt me with repetition. When I am only your dystopian Eve. There can be no valedictions here. So now our lives are cotton. And although cotton breathes, it is also the sarcophagus of our relationship. Embalmed memories. But I promise to dig you up. Like Heathcliff. Or Rossetti. I promise to unbind you and gather you in my arms. Skin on skin. My sweat will be our glue as I rip off that t-shirt and bond you to me one last time.",

It’s not the likes of these that sashay with guards or inmates in the know, but they walk on water. Today’s talk is on the meander of time in a 6 by 8, steel or brick walled, no angling for parole as you flirt with quarter worms slipping off stale crusts. There’s a depth beneath each brow, eyes full of whispers that float in clouds above activists with soft bodies falling like feathers. But the crowd is a meniscus, fully cushioned and evened out, unyielding to a line of police officers swallowed in masks. I see oceans, la-di-da, a shimmer of hope in a new yesterday, but today’s a long way to the sea. I’m a blind fish without a name and, right now, I can’t breathe.",

    "text": "Vulnerable as forest red-tailed black cockatoos, you went south the day the stock market headed south. I consoled myself by re-watching North by Northwest, filmed partly on location in South Dakota and California, and inspiration for South by Southwest, which takes place in America’s Lone Star State. The Secret History’s Charles Macaulay wound up washing dishes in a Texan diner, but was born in Virginia with a silver spoon in his mouth; Richard Papen returned to The Golden State and read the Jacobean dramatists. If I were a Greek god I’d be Notus: I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. While at college, Elizabeth Bishop wrote about a hawk, but I’m more enamoured of ‘lamé with lights’, from North & South’s ‘From the Country to the City’. My maternal grandmother, Betty, who lived and died in the small northern town in which she was born, played bridge in a silver lamé dress, always South, always partnered with North. Elizabeth Bishop sailed south to Brazil, I flew north in Australia, to where the Banksian black cockatoo’s kree can bring the air to a standstill. I used to be a sucker for a man with a mouth full of South, a tongue like a southern cassowary’s claw, but the nickname Wombat, after the southern hairy-nosed species, is awful. It’s easy to find true north if you stop playing ‘A Forest’ by The Cure.",

    "text": "Say that it is possible to live without knowing why. The meanest may love as fully as the noblest, may love even more because completely. Then the meanest becomes if not the noblest, surely the highest among the lowest. Look how he goes to her with radiant looks, into her being. She receives him patiently, will learn to wear his passion as a gift enwrapping her with the silks and golden clothing of his gaze, the simple yet enriched embroideries of his wonderment. He kneels before her parents and begs to be admitted into their beliefs that were as alien to him as his to them. He belongs with her and she acknowledges his need, accepting its seed and birth in her, or she sees the maker in him, stands before him without guile or much hope, almost transcendental to the demiurge that moves her. He leans a little her way, out of a press of circumstantial maleness, wanting extensions in his children while she is already a mother. They who have never loved have never lived. They have not died but been and gone as singly as a seed of stone, not fruitfully but as a grain of sand without the wisdom of its processing, the shattering that makes whole.I humble myself before the lovers, the beautiful and the ugly believers. The singular couples that know if only for a moment or years of moments, fulfilment. In this fashion fulfilment is ecstasy, is blessed redemption from barren, wholly solipsistic selfhood. And in some, the loving self has flowered miraculous among weed, and a tree has towered through a choking vine up to its abiding need of the making light. The leaf of love has split the adamant of selfhood. Even the chill hunger of the lonely mystic in a cold clime thaws beneath the nourishing dayspring of love. You say the darker side of love has blighted myriads, yet isn’t it the aberration of possessiveness, the greed of envy, the obsidian heart of rapacity, even the amiable habit of coupling lives next door to hate? But these make up another poem that must be written by another man, beginning with lack as I began with loving’s plenitude.",

Pathetic, I wound my watch, slowly, to linger in the space and lived peacefully in my apartment for ages. There was a cup of tea and Zoë with her feet up on the windowsill.

I can’t see them or hear them because in the house of my name is a room of silence and a huge window of fog. But I know they are there. My name is certified in a gold frame that hangs on the room’s wall. Every time they move, it shakes. At first, I didn’t worry. But now they have begun rubbing their sleeve over my name’s glass. They are rubbing in circles that are gradually widening. I scream that they can’t do this and repeatedly show them the gold frame. They take no notice. They keep on rubbing. They rub until the fog disappears and their face becomes visible. Now, I am afraid for my name’s safety. The frame is shaking more rapidly though I have set up all conceivable defences. I have padded my name’s wall with photos of myself. I have entered my name on lists. I have dispatched letters in all possible directions. Nothing is working. They have broken through my name’s door and are wandering the secret passageways as if everything’s already familiar. Perhaps they are a lost relative? When I question them, they glare sharply as if to say, ‘Who do you think you are?’ I run to get them the gold frame. I look for it on the wall but all that’s hanging there is this person’s coat dusty and torn. When I return, I find the locks on my name’s door have been changed and I can go neither in nor out.

At the fort above Grenoble, I peered over the precipice and imagined how wonderful it would feel to leap into pure space and be carried away by a thermal updraught over the terracotta roofs of the city and beyond, to the snow- capped mountains, past Chambéry, with Hannibal’s elephant fountain, past Megève, where George Segal and Glenda Jackson crashed their cars into each other, in Lost and Found, and even as far as Mont Blanc itself! Human birds must have lived here for, on the very crest of Mont Saint-Eynard, there are remnants of another, older fort. Almost a kilometre and a half up in the sky. Who were these people’s foe? Did they believe they were incarnations of eagles? To reach the fort, I must take a téléphérique, a kind of chair-lift, with the chairs encased inside a perspex embryo. As I ascended over the Isère, and the older part of town, it occurred to me how much my life has been like living in a bubble. I am rootless; I am ignorant of the state of affairs in the world; I understand so little of the workings of the places I visit, always the stranger in town. I have basic wants: a roof over my head for the night, something to eat, a good bottle of wine on occasion, some human warmth every now and then. A bubble is a paradis artificiel, then? A temporary state, selfish, not bound by responsibilities. One in which I am free to roam without a care in the world. It is also a fragile state, suspension ... if the cable were to break ...?",

There was something, yes: but not a rent apparent to the eye, not a cloud breaking, nor the way a cloud amassing shreds a tumbling skein of light. A rusted carriage wheel half-jutted from the mud. The metal mattered in that place, a graph sown in the earth. Fertility, but of another order from the one that’s often reckoned, the human and inhuman knitted in the summer heat. This is where we talked. You turned to me a troubled cheek, the air tore, it was done. The rift, which had no other work, became the thought of sex in us.

Looking down aghast, in wonder at the changing scene ... lost memories of youth. Flood of a biscuit-coloured sea, brick-coloured combers purling with a scum of yellow soup atop and, in the tide, appearing as the hooded ghosts of ocean, the only blue reminders of an oncoming sea, the ‘blubbers’ (how here preserved so blue?). Jellyfish a foot across the dome ... equivalents of human heads with, under each, a mouth grotesquely stuffed with, what appear to me, blue thick fingers of incumbent idiocy. Here is a scene, I won’t go away and forget ... those blue shapes! Here is the sea baiting me with infelicities of colours. Shall eyes turn purist and give praise to ‘blubbers’—the sea a mockery of colour for which the sea was ever praised? I’ve never welcomed sight of ‘blubber’ on the tide before this humid summer evening’s grey defeat of a blue sky, smothering with off- shore smog (not spume) the sun’s last function of the day ... the Medusa welcomed here as sea’s last mockery of the legendary Gorgons.

Sand is not earth but a fluid shoreline that leads to the great cities. When we are tired we buy up land on the edges of the great cities so we can sit and watch the insomniac journey of sand. Its slow exodus across the horizon teaches us how to prepare for sleep. When flowers open on a day filled with sand all the water in the world will not quench their thirst. I send words to you from so far off aiming to shape you towards the exquisite openness of love, but over and over I collapse in the effort to invent a life. Walking on sand has taught me I can no longer count on making it to any shore. Your eyes as I imagine them I will go on kissing gently and sheltering beneath. It may be that simply wishing you such tenderness will help you wake one day calmer, more deeply held by the world’s alignment, ready to find another and love.

I was looking for a great encyclopaedia, the secret dictionary of all the missing words. I wanted to consult its index and find out what I could have become. The sound the clock makes when it is disconnected and taken down from the wall but can’t lose the habit of trying to jerk itself forward. The look of old socks drying on a rack in the kitchen all through a winter night, hanging starched and sad opposite the wedding photographs. A word for your face when you know you can’t love but would almost like to try. The blurred point of merger between fresh storm damage to a house and the deep fissures that have always been there. Walking down the corridor to the front door with inexplicable elation in my chest as if everything was about to start, as if my love had just arrived, escaped from a burning world, and at the same time clenched in my taut wrists, my hands, the thin bones of my arms, the certainty that everything has long been over.",

For a moment she glimpses his eyes staring at her from the back of the jogger’s head. It’s touching the tricks memory has started to play on her.

    "text": "i recall those poems of white lanterns and papery fans as you wave your blonde hair and eyeballs around the room in an orchestra of curls and lashes. instead of eating lunch you are reading the fortunes of four women on a summer afternoon in a pack of cards decorated with pyramids. this is your day of work i say to you quite unexpectedly. eight eyes are tracking each flicker of your concentration. we are hot for truths. i see a trail of hearts down a street you say to me as you smoke on your cigarette like it is some flute but i also see an empty chair. watching you become the joys and tears of another as you enter our lives is very beautiful. you reflect like a mirror you grow so young. you luminesce shifting into another time and place as if your face is being slowly filtered into a previous self. you are now miss dorothea prince in her flat in north london in 1938. who lived in the dim light behind heavy curtains, circled by her cats cigarettes glasses of brandy and nervous clairvoyance. you died of loneliness and kidney condition just before the bombing of london. you say you understand these things. as a small boy you had a dream which you quickly turned away from about such a woman. those dark curtains you whisper those dark curtains. we sit in the twilight of the day. this room is cool with its high ceilings. we are surrounded by vast veils of ether so it seems. we talk about our lives and i hold my hands about your head and we are silent for a while. the evening draws us outside with its softnesses and so we approach the zones of the city with those long thin streets open before us.",
