Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain, For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain. All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair! The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one, Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be, Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree. The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small, None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives, And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son. The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune, The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows, No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose. The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride, Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true, And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue. Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul: Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone, Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown. Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long, And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song? There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair, And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair! Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time! Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower, And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower - And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum - And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!\""

    "author": "Elizabeth Bishop",
    "text": "\"Although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting, his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, a dark purple-brown, and his shuttle worn and polished. The air smells so strong of codfish it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water. The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls. The big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail, with small iridescent flies crawling on them. Up on the little slope behind the houses, set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, is an ancient wooden capstan, cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted. The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. He was a friend of my grandfather. We talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in. There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, the blade of which is almost worn away. Down at the water's edge, at the place where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp descending into the water, thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones, down and down at intervals of four or five feet. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, element bearable to no mortal, to fish and to seals... One seal particularly I have seen here evening after evening. He was curious about me. He was interested in music like me a believer in total immersion, so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. I also sang \\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.\\\" He stood up in the water and regarded me steadily, moving his head a little. Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, the clear gray icy water... Back, behind us, the dignified tall firs begin. Bluish, associating with their shadows, a million Christmas trees stand waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. If you should dip your hand in, your wrist would ache immediately, your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.\""

He hung a grunting weight, battered and venerable and homely. Here and there his brown skin hung in strips like ancient wallpaper, and its pattern of darker brown was like wallpaper: shapes like full-blown roses stained and lost through age. He was speckled with barnacles, fine rosettes of lime, and infested with tiny white sea-lice, and underneath two or three rags of green weed hung down. While his gills were breathing in the terrible oxygen -the frightening gills, fresh and crisp with blood, that can cut so badly- I thought of the coarse white flesh packed in like feathers, the big bones and the little bones, the dramatic reds and blacks of his shiny entrails, and the pink swim-bladder like a big peony. I looked into his eyes which were far larger than mine but shallower, and yellowed, the irises backed and packed with tarnished tinfoil seen through the lenses of old scratched isinglass. They shifted a little, but not to return my stare. -It was more like the tipping of an object toward the light. I admired his sullen face, the mechanism of his jaw, and then I saw that from his lower lip -if you could call it a lip grim, wet, and weaponlike, hung five old pieces of fish-line, or four and a wire leader with the swivel still attached, with all their five big hooks grown firmly in his mouth. A green line, frayed at the end where he broke it, two heavier lines, and a fine black thread still crimped from the strain and snap when it broke and he got away. Like medals with their ribbons frayed and wavering, a five-haired beard of wisdom trailing from his aching jaw. I stared and stared and victory filled up the little rented boat, from the pool of bilge where oil had spread a rainbow around the rusted engine to the bailer rusted orange, the sun-cracked thwarts, the oarlocks on their strings, the gunnels-until everything was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go.\""

I'm afraid if it's wheat it's none of your sowing, nevertheless I'd like to know what you are doing and where you are going.\""

    "text": "\"for Robert Lowell This is the time of year when almost every night the frail, illegal fire balloons appear. Climbing the mountain height, rising toward a saint still honored in these parts, the paper chambers flush and fill with light that comes and goes, like hearts. Once up against the sky it's hard to tell them from the stars- planets, that is-the tinted ones: Venus going down, or Mars, or the pale green one. With a wind, they flare and falter, wobble and toss but if it's still they steer between the kite sticks of the Southern Cross, receding, dwindling, solemnly and steadily forsaking us, or, in the downdraft from a peak, suddenly turning dangerous. Last night another big one fell. It splattered like an egg of fire against the cliff behind the house. The flame ran down. We saw the pair of owls who nest there flying up and up, their whirling black-and-white stained bright pink underneath, until they shrieked up out of sight. The ancient owls' nest must have burned. Hastily, all alone, a glistening armadillo left the scene, rose-flecked, head down, tail down, and then a baby rabbit jumped out, short-eared, to our surprise. So soft!-a handful of intangible ash with fixed, ignited eyes. Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry! O falling fire and piercing cry and panic, and a weak mailed fist clenched ignorant against the sky!\""

This month, our favorite one is full of flowers: Buttercups, Red Clover, Purple Vetch, Hackweed still burning, Daisies pied, Eyebright, the Fragrant Bedstraw's incandescent stars, and more, returned, to paint the meadows with delight. The Goldfinches are back, or others like them, and the White-throated Sparrow's five-note song, pleading and pleading, brings tears to the eyes. Nature repeats herself, or almost does: repeat, repeat, repeat revise, revise, revise. Years ago, you told me it was here (in ?) you first \\\"discovered girls\\\" and learned to sail, and learned to kiss. You had \\\"such fun,\\\" you said, that classic summer.

The waiting room was full of grown-up people, arctics and overcoats, lamps and magazines. My aunt was inside what seemed like a long time and while I waited and read the National Geographic (I could read) and carefully studied the photographs: the inside of a volcano, black, and full of ashes then it was spilling over in rivulets of fire. Osa and Martin Johnson dressed in riding breeches, laced boots, and pith helmets. A dead man slung on a pole \\\"Long Pig,\\\" the caption said. Babies with pointed heads wound round and round with string black, naked women with necks wound round and round with wire like the necks of light bulbs. Their breasts were horrifying. I read it right straight through. I was too shy to stop. And then I looked at the cover: the yellow margins, the date. Suddenly, from inside, came an oh! of pain -Aunt Consuelo's voice- not very loud or long. I wasn't at all surprised even then I knew she was a foolish, timid woman. I might have been embarrassed, but wasn't. What took me completely by surprise was that it was me: my voice, in my mouth. Without thinking at all I was my foolish aunt, I-we-were falling, falling, our eyes glued to the cover of the National Geographic, February, . I said to myself: three days and you'll be seven years old. I was saying it to stop the sensation of falling off the round, turning world. into cold, blue-black space. But I felt: you are an I, you are an Elizabeth, you are one of them. Why should you be one, too? I scarcely dared to look to see what it was I was. I gave a sidelong glance -I couldn't look any higher- at shadowy gray knees, trousers and skirts and boots and different pairs of hands lying under the lamps. I knew that nothing stranger had ever happened, that nothing stranger could ever happen. Why should I be my aunt, or me, or anyone? What similarities boots, hands, the family voice I felt in my throat, or even the National Geographic and those awful hanging breasts held us all together or made us all just one? How I didn't know any word for it how \\\"unlikely\\\"... How had I come to be here, like them, and overhear a cry of pain that could have got loud and worse but hadn't? The waiting room was bright and too hot. It was sliding beneath a big black wave, another, and another. Then I was back in it. The War was on. Outside, in Worcester, Massachusetts, were night and slush and cold, and it was still the fifth of February, .\""

Above the dusty lanes of suburbia Above the tedium of bungalows A pretzel sign begilds a bakery And children screech fortissimo. And every evening beyond the barriers Gentlemen of practiced wit and charm Go strolling beside the drainage ditches - A tilted derby and a lady at the arm. The squeak of oarlocks comes over the lake water A woman's shriek assaults the ear While above, in the sky, inured to everything, The moon looks on with a mindless leer. And every evening my one companion Sits here, reflected in my glass. Like me, he has drunk of bitter mysteries. Like me, he is broken, dulled, downcast. The sleepy lackeys stand beside tables Waiting for the night to pass And tipplers with the eyes of rabbits Cry out: \\\"In vino veritas!\\\" And every evening (or am I imagining?) Exactly at the appointed time A girl's slim figure, silk raimented, Glides past the window's mist and grime. And slowly passing throught the revelers, Unaccompanied, always alone, Exuding mists and secret fragrances, She sits at the table that is her own. Something ancient, something legendary Surrounds her presence in the room, Her narrow hand, her silk, her bracelets, Her hat, the rings, the ostrich plume. Entranced by her presence, near and enigmatic, I gaze through the dark of her lowered veil And I behold an enchanted shoreline And enchanted distances, far and pale. I am made a guardian of the higher mysteries, Someone's sun is entrusted to my control. Tart wine has pierced the last convolution of my labyrinthine soul. And now the drooping plumes of ostriches Asway in my brain droop slowly lower And two eyes, limpid, blue, and fathomless Are blooming on a distant shore. Inside my soul a treasure is buried. The key is mine and only mine. How right you are, you drunken monster! I know: the truth is in the wine.\""

    "text": "\". Cogida and death At five in the afternoon. It was exactly five in the afternoon. A boy brought the white sheet at five in the afternoon. A frail of lime ready prepared at five in the afternoon. The rest was death, and death alone. The wind carried away the cottonwool at five in the afternoon. And the oxide scattered crystal and nickel at five in the afternoon. Now the dove and the leopard wrestle at five in the afternoon. And a thigh with a desolated horn at five in the afternoon. The bass-string struck up at five in the afternoon. Arsenic bells and smoke at five in the afternoon. Groups of silence in the corners at five in the afternoon. And the bull alone with a high heart! At five in the afternoon. When the sweat of snow was coming at five in the afternoon, when the bull ring was covered with iodine at five in the afternoon. Death laid eggs in the wound at five in the afternoon. At five in the afternoon. At five o'clock in the afternoon. A coffin on wheels is his bed at five in the afternoon. Bones and flutes resound in his ears at five in the afternoon. Now the bull was bellowing through his forehead at five in the afternoon. The room was iridiscent with agony at five in the afternoon. In the distance the gangrene now comes at five in the afternoon. Horn of the lily through green groins at five in the afternoon. The wounds were burning like suns at five in the afternoon. At five in the afternoon. Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon! It was five by all the clocks! It was five in the shade of the afternoon! . The Spilled Blood I will not see it! Tell the moon to come, for I do not want to see the blood of Ignacio on the sand. I will not see it! The moon wide open. Horse of still clouds, and the grey bull ring of dreams with willows in the barreras. I will not see it! Let my memory kindle! Warm the jasmines of such minute whiteness! I will not see it! The cow of the ancient world passed har sad tongue over a snout of blood spilled on the sand, and the bulls of Guisando, partly death and partly stone, bellowed like two centuries sated with threading the earth. No. I will not see it! Ignacio goes up the tiers with all his death on his shoulders. He sought for the dawn but the dawn was no more. He seeks for his confident profile and the dream bewilders him He sought for his beautiful body and encountered his opened blood Do not ask me to see it! I do not want to hear it spurt each time with less strength: that spurt that illuminates the tiers of seats, and spills over the cordury and the leather of a thirsty multiude. Who shouts that I should come near! Do not ask me to see it! His eyes did not close when he saw the horns near, but the terrible mothers lifted their heads. And across the ranches, an air of secret voices rose, shouting to celestial bulls, herdsmen of pale mist. There was no prince in Sevilla who could compare to him, nor sword like his sword nor heart so true. Like a river of lions was his marvellous strength, and like a marble toroso his firm drawn moderation. The air of Andalusian Rome gilded his head where his smile was a spikenard of wit and intelligence. What a great torero in the ring! What a good peasant in the sierra! How gentle with the sheaves! How hard with the spurs! How tender with the dew! How dazzling the fiesta! How tremendous with the final banderillas of darkness! But now he sleeps without end. Now the moss and the grass open with sure fingers the flower of his skull. And now his blood comes out singing singing along marshes and meadows, sliden on frozen horns, faltering soulles in the mist stoumbling over a thousand hoofs like a long, dark, sad tongue, to form a pool of agony close to the starry Guadalquivir. Oh, white wall of Spain! Oh, black bull of sorrow! Oh, hard blood of Ignacio! Oh, nightingale of his veins! No. I will not see it! No chalice can contain it, no swallows can drink it, no frost of light can cool it, nor song nor deluge og white lilies, no glass can cover mit with silver. No. I will not see it! . The Laid Out Body Stone is a forehead where dreames grieve without curving waters and frozen cypresses. Stone is a shoulder on which to bear Time with trees formed of tears and ribbons and planets. I have seen grey showers move towards the waves raising their tender riddle arms, to avoid being caught by lying stone which loosens their limbs without soaking their blood. For stone gathers seed and clouds, skeleton larks and wolves of penumbra: but yields not sounds nor crystals nor fire, only bull rings and bull rings and more bull rings without walls. Now, Ignacio the well born lies on the stone. All is finished. What is happening! Contemplate his face: death has covered him with pale sulphur and has place on him the head of dark minotaur. All is finished. The rain penetrates his mouth. The air, as if mad, leaves his sunken chest, and Love, soaked through with tears of snow, warms itself on the peak of the herd. What is they saying? A stenching silence settles down. We are here with a body laid out which fades away, with a pure shape which had nightingales and we see it being filled with depthless holes. Who creases the shroud? What he says is not true! Nobody sings here, nobody weeps in the corner, nobody pricks the spurs, nor terrifies the serpent. Here I want nothing else but the round eyes to see his body without a chance of rest. Here I want to see those men of hard voice. Those that break horses and dominate rivers those men of sonorous skeleton who sing with a mouth full of sun and flint. Here I want to see them. Before the stone. Before this body with broken reins. I want to know from them the way out for this captain stripped down by death. I want them to show me a lament like a river wich will have sweet mists and deep shores, to take the body of Ignacio where it looses itself without hearing the double planting of the bulls. Loses itself in the round bull ring of the moon which feigns in its youth a sad quiet bull, loses itself in the night without song of fishes and in the white thicket of frozen smoke. I don't want to cover his face with handkerchiefs that he may get used to the death he carries. Go, Ignacio, feel not the hot bellowing Sleep, fly, rest: even the sea dies! . Absent Soul The bull does not know you, nor the fig tree, nor the horses, nor the ants in your own house. The child and the afternoon do not know you because you have dead forever. The shoulder of the stone does not know you nor the black silk, where you are shuttered. Your silent memory does not know you because you have died forever The autumn will come with small white snails, misty grapes and clustered hills, but no one will look into your eyes because you have died forever. Because you have died for ever, like all the dead of the earth, like all the dead who are forgotten in a heap of lifeless dogs. Nobady knows you. No. But I sing of you. For posterity I sing of your profile and grace. Of the signal maturity of your understanding. Of your appetite for death and the taste of its mouth. Of the sadness of your once valiant gaiety. It will be a long time, if ever, before there is born an Andalusian so true, so rich in adventure. I sing of his elegance with words that groan, and I remember a sad breeze through the olive trees.\""

The lanterns went out and the crickets lighted up. In the farthest street corners I touched her sleeping breasts and they opened to me suddenly like spikes of hyacinth. The starch of her petticoat sounded in my ears like a piece of silk rent by ten knives. Without silver light on their foliage the trees had grown larger and a horizon of dogs barked very far from the river. Past the blackberries, the reeds and the hawthorne underneath her cluster of hair I made a hollow in the earth I took off my tie, she too off her dress. I, my belt with the revolver, She, her four bodices. Nor nard nor mother-o?pearl have skin so fine, nor does glass with silver shine with such brilliance. Her thighs slipped away from me like startled fish, half full of fire, half full of cold. That night I ran on the best of roads mounted on a nacre mare without bridle stirrups. As a man, I wont repeat the things she said to me. The light of understanding has made me more discreet. Smeared with sand and kisses I took her away from the river. The swords of the lilies battled with the air. I behaved like what I am, like a proper gypsy. I gave her a large sewing basket, of straw-colored satin, but I did not fall in love for although she had a husband she told me she was a maiden when I took her to the river.\""

The starless silence, fleeing from her rhythmic tambourine, falls where the sea whips and sings, his night filled with silvery swarms. High atop the mountain peaks the sentinels are weeping they guard the tall white towers of the English consulate. And gypsies of the water for their pleasure erect little castles of conch shells and arbors of greening pine. Playing her parchment moon Precosia comes. The wind sees her and rises, the wind that never slumbers. Naked Saint Christopher swells, watching the girl as he plays with tongues of celestial bells on an invisible bagpipe. Gypsy, let me lift your skirt and have a look at you. Open in my ancient fingers the blue rose of your womb. Precosia throws the tambourine and runs away in terror. But the virile wind pursues her with his breathing and burning sword. The sea darkens and roars, while the olive trees turn pale. The flutes of darkness sound, and a muted gong of the snow. Precosia, run, Precosia! Or the green wind will catch you! Precosia, run, Precosia! And look how fast he comes! A satyr of low-born stars with their long and glistening tongues. Precosia, filled with fear, now makes her way to that house beyond the tall green pines where the English consul lives. Alarmed by the anguished cries, three riflemen come running, their black capes tightly drawn, and berets down over their brow. The Englishman gives the gypsy a glass of tepid milk and a shot of Holland gin which Precosia does not drink. And while she tells them, weeping, of her strange adventure, the wind furiously gnashes against the slate roof tiles.\""

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death, The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies, We, the people, must redeem The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.

Look at my face - dark as the night - Yet shining like the sun with love's true light. I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea Carrying in my body the seed of the free. I am the woman who worked in the field Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield. I am the one who labored as a slave, Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave - Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too. No safety , no love, no respect was I due. Three hundred years in the deepest South: But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth . God put a dream like steel in my soul. Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal. Now, through my children, young and free, I realized the blessing deed to me. I couldn't read then. I couldn't write. I had nothing, back there in the night. Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears, But I kept trudging on through the lonely years. Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun, But I had to keep on till my work was done: I had to keep on! No stopping for me - I was the seed of the coming Free. I nourished the dream that nothing could smother Deep in my breast - the Negro mother. I had only hope then , but now through you, Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true: All you dark children in the world out there, Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair. Remember my years, heavy with sorrow - And make of those years a torch for tomorrow. Make of my pass a road to the light Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night. Lift high my banner out of the dust. Stand like free men supporting my trust. Believe in the right, let none push you back. Remember the whip and the slaver's track. Remember how the strong in struggle and strife Still bar you the way, and deny you life - But march ever forward, breaking down bars. Look ever upward at the sun and the stars. Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers Impel you forever up the great stairs - For I will be with you till no white brother Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.\""

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it. I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset. I've known rivers: Ancient, dusky rivers. My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\""

I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem. I went to school there, then Durham, then here to this college on the hill above Harlem. I am the only colored student in my class. The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem, through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas, Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y, the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator up to my room, sit down, and write this page: It's not easy to know what is true for you or me at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you: hear you, hear me-we two-you, me, talk on this page. (I hear New York, too.) Me-who? Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. I like a pipe for a Christmas present, or records-Bessie, bop, or Bach. I guess being colored doesn't make me not like the same things other folks like who are other races. So will my page be colored that I write? Being me, it will not be white. But it will be a part of you, instructor. You are white- yet a part of me, as I am a part of you. That's American. Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me. Nor do I often want to be a part of you. But we are, that's true! As I learn from you, I guess you learn from me- although you're older-and white- and somewhat more free. This is my page for English B.\""

With his ebony hands on each ivory key He made that poor piano moan with melody. O Blues! Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool. Sweet Blues! Coming from a black man's soul. O Blues! In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan- \\\"Ain't got nobody in all this world, Ain't got nobody but ma self. I's gwine to quit ma frownin' And put ma troubles on the shelf.\\\" Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor. He played a few chords then he sang some more- \\\"I got the Weary Blues And I can't be satisfied. Got the Weary Blues And can't be satisfied- I ain't happy no mo' And I wish that I had died.\\\" And far into the night he crooned that tune. The stars went out and so did the moon.

Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of machinery. The only water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily. Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust- -I rushed up enchanted-it was my first sunflower, memories of Blake-my visions-Harlem and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms &amp pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past- and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye- corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like a dried wire spiderweb, leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear, Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O my soul, I loved you then! The grime was no man's grime but death and human locomotives, all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt-industrial- modern-all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown- and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs &amp sphincters of dynamos-all these entangled in your mummied roots-and you standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form! A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly breeze! How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your grime, while you cursed the heavens of your railroad and your flower soul? Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a flower? when did you look at your skin and decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive? the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive? You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a sunflower! And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me not! So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck it at my side like a scepter, and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack's soul too, and anyone who'll listen, -We're not our skin of grime, we're not our dread bleak dusty imageless locomotive, we're all golden sunflowers inside, blessed by our own seed &amp hairy naked accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening sitdown vision.

The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight? (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.) Will we walk all night through solitary streets?

    "text": "\"- for Naomi Ginsberg, - I Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets &amp eyes, while I walk on the sunny pavement of Greenwhich Village. downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night, talking, talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues should blind on the phonograph the rhythm the rhythm - and your memory in my head three years after - And read Adonais' last triumphant stanzas aloud - wept, realizing how we suffer - And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of Answers - and my own imagination of a withered leaf - at dawn - Dreaming back thru life, Your time - and mine accelerating toward Apocalypse, the final moment - the flower burning in the Day - and what comes after, looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city a flash away, and a great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed - like a poem in the dark - escaped back to Oblivion - No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream, trapped in its disappearance, sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worshipping each other, worshipping the God included in it all - longing or inevitability? - while it lasts, a Vision - anything more? It leaps about me, as I go out and walk the street, look back over my shoulder, Seventh Avenue, the battlements of window office buildings shouldering each other high, under a cloud, tall as the sky an instant - and the sky above - an old blue place. or down the Avenue to the south - as I walk toward the Lower East Side - where you walked years ago, little girl - from Russian, eating the first poisonous tomatoes of America - frightened at the dock - then struggling in the crowds of Orchard Street toward what? - toward Newark - toward candy store, first home-made sodas of our century, hand-churned ice cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards - Toward education marriage nervous breakdown, operation, teaching school, and learning to be mad, in a dream - what is this life? Toward the Key in the window - and the great Key lays its head of light on top of Manhattan, and over the floor, and lays down on the sidewalk - in a single vast beam, moving, as I walk down First toward the Yiddish Theater - and the place of poverty you knew, and I know, but without caring now - Strange to have moved thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again, with the cries of Spaniards now in the doorstoops doors and dark boys on the street, fire escapes old as you - Tho, you're not old now, that's left here with me - Myself, anyhow, maybe as old as the universe - and I guess that dies with us - enough to cancel all that comes - What came is gone forever every time - That's good! That leaves it open for no regret - no fear radiators, lacklove, torture even toothache in the end - Though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul - and the lamb, the soul, in us, alas, offering itself in sacrifice to change's fierce hunger - hair and teeth - and the roar of bonepain, skull bare, break rib, rot-skin, braintricked Implacability. Ai! ai! we do worse! We are in a fix! And you're out, Death let you out, Death had the Mercy, you're done with your century, done with God, done with the path thru it - Done with yourself at last - Pure - Back to the Babe dark before your Father, before us all - befpre the world - There, rest. No more suffering for you. I know where you've gone, it's good. No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more fear of Louis, and no more of his sweetness and glasses, his high school decades, debts, loves, frightened telephone calls, conception beds, relatives, hands - No more of sister Elanor, - she gone before you - we kept it secret - you killed her - or she killed herself to bear with you - an arthritic heart - But Death's killed you both - No matter - Nor your memory of your mother, tears in silent movies weeks and weeks - forgetting, agrieve watching Marie Dressler address humanity, Chaplin dance in youth, or Boris Godunov, Chaliapin's at the Met, halling his voice is a weeping Czar - by standing room with Elanor &amp Max - watching also teh Capitalists take seats in Orchestra, white furs, diamonds, with the YPSL's hitch-hiking thru Pennsylvania, in black baggy gym skirts pants, photograph of girls holding each other round the waste, and laughing eye, too coy, virginal solitude of all girls grown old, or dead, now, and that long hair in the grave - lucky to have husbands later - You made it - I came too - Eugene my brother before (still grieving now and will gream on to his last stiff hand, as he goes thru his cancer - or kill - later perhaps - soon he will think - ) And it's the last moment I remember, which I see them all, thru myself, now - tho not you I didn't foresee what you felt - what more hideous gape of bad mouth came first - to you - and were you prepared? To go where? In that Dark - that - in that God? a radiance? A Lord in the Void? Like an eye in the black cloud in a dream? Adonoi at last, with you? Beyond my remembrance! Incapable to guess! Not merely the yellow skull in the grave, or box of worm dust, and a stained ribbon - Deaths- head with Halo? can you believe it? Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence, than none ever was? Nothing beyond what we have - what you had - that so pitiful - yet Triumph, to have been here, and changed, like a tree, broken, or flower - fed to the ground - but mad, with its petals, colored, thinking Great Universe, shaken, cut in the head, leaf stript, hid in an egg crate hospital, cloth wrapped, sore - freaked in the moon brain, Naughtless. No flower like that flowerm which knew itself in the garden, and fought the knife - lost Cut down by an idiot Snowman's icy - even in the Spring - strange ghost thought - some Death - Sharp icicle in his hand - crowned with old roses - a dog for his eyes - cock of a sweatshop - heart of electric irons. All the accumulations of life, that wear us out - clocks, bodies, consciousness, shoes, breasts - begotten sons - your Communism - 'Paranoia' into hospitals. You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later. You of stroke. Asleep? within a year, the two of you, sisters in death. Is Elanor happy? Max grieves alive in an office on Lower Broadway, lone large mustache over midnight Accountings, not sure. His life passes - as he sees - and what does he doubt now? Still dream of making money, or that might have made money, hired nurse, had children, found even your Immortality, Naomi? I'll see him soon. Now I've got to cut through - to talk to you - as I didn't when you had a mouth. Forever. And we're bound for that, Forever - like Emily Dickinson's horses - headed to the End. They know the way - These Steeds - run faster than we think - it's our own life they cross - and take with them. Magnificent, mourned no more, marred of heart, mind behind, married dreamed, mortal changed - Ass and face done with murder. In the world, given, flower maddened, made no Utopia, shut under pine, almed in Earth, balmed in Lone, Jehovah, accept. Nameless, One Faced, Forever beyond me, beginningless, endless, Father in death. Tho I am not there for this Prophecy, I am unmarried, I'm Hymnless, I'm Heavenless, headless in blisshood I would still adore Thee, Heaven, after Death, only One blessed in Nothingness, not light or darkness, Dayless Eternity - Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day, some of my Time, now given to Nothing - to praise Thee - But Death This is the end, the redemption from Wilderness, way for the Wonderer, House sought for All, black handkerchief washed clean by weeping - page beyond Psalm - Last change of mine and Naomi - to God's perfect Darkness - Death, stay thy phantoms!

Will he later hallucinate his gods? Waking among mysteries with an insane gleam of recollection? The recognition- something so rare in his soul, met only in dreams -nostalgias of another life. A question of the soul. And the injured losing their injury in their innocence -a cock, a cross, an excellence of love.

II Yet Spade reminded me of Angel, unloading a bus, dressed in blue overalls black face official Angel's work- man cap, pushing with his belly a huge tin horse piled high with black baggage, looking up as he passed the yellow light bulb of the loft and holding high on his arm an iron shepherd's crook. III It was the racks, I realized, sitting myself on top of them now as is my wont at lunchtime to rest my tired foot, it was the racks, great wooden shelves and stanchions posts and beams assembled floor to roof jumbled with baggage, -the Japanese white metal postwar trunk gaudily flowered &amp headed for Fort Bragg, one Mexican green paper package in purple rope adorned with names for Nogales, hundreds of radiators all at once for Eureka, crates of Hawaiian underwear, rolls of posters scattered over the Peninsula, nuts to Sacramento, one human eye for Napa, an aluminum box of human blood for Stockton and a little red package of teeth for Calistoga- it was the racks and these on the racks I saw naked in electric light the night before I quit, the racks were created to hang our possessions, to keep us together, a temporary shift in space, God's only way of building the rickety structure of Time, to hold the bags to send on the roads, to carry our luggage from place to place looking for a bus to ride us back home to Eternity where the heart was left and farewell tears began. IV A swarm of baggage sitting by the counter as the trans- continental bus pulls in. The clock registering : A.M., May , , the second hand moving forward, red. Getting ready to load my last bus.-Farewell, Walnut Creek Richmond Vallejo Portland Pacific Highway Fleet-footed Quicksilver, God of transience. One last package sits lone at midnight sticking up out of the Coast rack high as the dusty fluorescent light. The wage they pay us is too low to live on. Tragedy reduced to numbers. This for the poor shepherds. I am a communist. Farewell ye Greyhound where I suffered so much, hurt my knee and scraped my hand and built my pectoral muscles big as a vagina. - May ,\""

Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb. I don't feel good don't bother me. I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind. America when will you be angelic? When will you take off your clothes? When will you look at yourself through the grave? When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites? America why are your libraries full of tears? America when will you send your eggs to India? I'm sick of your insane demands. When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks? America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world. Your machinery is too much for me. You made me want to be a saint. There must be some other way to settle this argument. Burroughs is in Tangiers I don't think he'll come back it's sinister. Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke? I'm trying to come to the point. I refuse to give up my obsession. America stop pushing I know what I'm doing. America the plum blossoms are falling. I haven't read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder. America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies. America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry. I smoke marijuana every chance I get. I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet. When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid. My mind is made up there's going to be trouble. You should have seen me reading Marx. My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right. I won't say the Lord's Prayer. I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations. America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia. I'm addressing you. Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine? I'm obsessed by Time Magazine. I read it every week. Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore. I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library. It's always telling me about responsibility. Business- men are serious. Movie producers are serious. Everybody's serious but me. It occurs to me that I am America. I am talking to myself again. Asia is rising against me. I haven't got a chinaman's chance. I'd better consider my national resources. My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that goes miles an hour and twenty-five-thousand mental institutions. I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns. I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go. My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I'm a Catholic. America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood? I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so they're all different sexes. America I will sell you strophes $ apiece $ down on your old strophe America free Tom Mooney America save the Spanish Loyalists America Sacco &amp Vanzetti must not die America I am the Scottsboro boys. America when I was seven momma took me to Com- munist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sin- cere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor made me cry I once saw Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy. America you don't really want to go to war. America it's them bad Russians. Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians. The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia's power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Readers' Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingsta- tions. That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help. America this is quite serious. America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set. America is this correct? I'd better get right down to the job. It's true I don't want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I'm nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.

I began to feel my misery in pallet on floor, listening to music, my misery, that's why I want to sing. The room closed down on me, I expected the presence of the Creator, I saw my gray painted walls and ceiling, they contained my room, they contained me as the sky contained my garden, I opened my door The rambler vine climbed up the cottage post, the leaves in the night still where the day had placed them, the animal heads of the flowers where they had arisen to think at the sun Can I bring back the words? Will thought of transcription haze my mental open eye? The kindly search for growth, the gracious de- sire to exist of the flowers, my near ecstasy at existing among them The privilege to witness my existence-you too must seek the sun... My books piled up before me for my use waiting in space where I placed them, they haven't disappeared, time's left its remnants and qual- ities for me to use-my words piled up, my texts, my manuscripts, my loves. I had a moment of clarity, saw the feeling in the heart of things, walked out to the garden crying. Saw the red blossoms in the night light, sun's gone, they had all grown, in a moment, and were wait- ing stopped in time for the day sun to come and give them... . Flowers which as in a dream at sunset I watered faithfully not knowing how much I loved them. I am so lonely in my glory-except they too out there-I looked up-those red bush blossoms beckon- ing and peering in the window waiting in blind love, their leaves too have hope and are upturned top flat to the sky to receive-all creation open to receive-the flat earth itself. The music descends, as does the tall bending stalk of the heavy blossom, because it has to, to stay alive, to continue to the last drop of joy. The world knows the love that's in its breast as in the flower, the suffering lonely world. The Father is merciful. The light socket is crudely attached to the ceil- ing, after the house was built, to receive a plug which sticks in it alright, and serves my phonograph now... The closet door is open for me, where I left it, since I left it open, it has graciously stayed open. The kitchen has no door, the hole there will admit me should I wish to enter the kitchen. I remember when I first got laid, H.P. gra- ciously took my cherry, I sat on the docks of Prov- incetown, age , joyful, elevated in hope with the Father, the door to the womb was open to admit me if I wished to enter. There are unused electricity plugs all over my house if I ever need them. The kitchen window is open, to admit air... The telephone-sad to relate-sits on the floor-I haven't the money to get it connected- I want people to bow as they see me and say he is gifted with poetry, he has seen the presence of the Creator. And the Creator gave me a shot of his presence to gratify my wish, so as not to cheat me of my yearning for him. - Berkeley, September ,\""

His face went gray, his eyes fluttered close a frightening moment...

I think you think I will never die, I think I exude to you the permanence of smoke or stars, even as my broken arms heal themselves around you. I have heard you tell the sun, don't go down, I have stood by as you told the flower, don't grow old, don't die. Little Maud, I would blow the flame out of your silver cup, I would suck the rot from your fingernail, I would brush your sprouting hair of the dying light, I would scrape the rust off your ivory bones, I would help death escape through the little ribs of your body, I would alchemize the ashes of your cradle back into wood, I would let nothing of you go, ever, until washerwomen feel the clothes fall asleep in their hands, and hens scratch their spell across hatchet blades, and rats walk away from the cultures of the plague, and iron twists weapons toward the true north, and grease refuses to slide in the machinery of progress, and men feel as free on earth as fleas on the bodies of men, and lovers no longer whisper to the presence beside them in the dark, O corpse-to-be ... And yet perhaps this is the reason you cry, this the nightmare you wake screaming from: being forever in the pre-trembling of a house that falls. In a restaurant once, everyone quietly eating, you clambered up on my lap: to all the mouthfuls rising toward all the mouths, at the top of your voice you cried your one word, caca! caca! caca! and each spoonful stopped, a moment, in midair, in its withering steam. Yes, you cling because I, like you, only sooner than you, will go down the path of vanished alphabets, the roadlessness to the other side of the darkness, your arms like the shoes left behind, like the adjectives in the halting speech of old men, which once could call up the lost nouns. And you yourself, some impossible Tuesday in the year Two Thousand and Nine, will walk out among the black stones of the field, in the rain, and the stones saying over their one word, ci-g?t, ci-g?t, ci-g?t, and the raindrops hitting you on the fontanel over and over, and you standing there unable to let them in. If one day it happens you find yourself with someone you love in a caf�� at one end of the Pont Mirabeau, at the zinc bar where white wine stands in upward opening glasses, and if you commit then, as we did, the error of thinking, one day all this will only be memory, learn, as you stand at this end of the bridge which arcs, from love, you think, into enduring love, learn to reach deeper into the sorrows to come �C to touch the almost imaginary bones under the face, to hear under the laughter the wind crying across the black stones. Kiss the mouth which tells you, here, here is the world. This mouth. This laughter. These temple bones. The still undanced cadence of vanishing. In the light the moon sends back, I can see in your eyes the hand that waved once in my father's eyes, a tiny kite wobbling far up in the twilight of his last look: and the angel of all mortal things lets go the string. Back you go, into your crib. The last blackbird lights up his gold wings: farewell. Your eyes close inside your head, in sleep. Already in your dreams the hours begin to sing. Little sleep's-head sprouting hair in the moonlight, when I come back we will go out together, we will walk out together among the ten thousand things, each scratched too late with such knowledge, the wages of dying is love.\""

Today on skis I took a friend to show her the trees. We set out down the road, turned in at the lane which a few weeks ago, when the trees were almost empty and the November snows had not yet come, lay thickly covered in bright red and yellow leaves, crossed the swamp, passed the cellar hole holding the remains of the s farmhouse that had slid down into it by stages in the thirties and forties, followed the overgrown logging road and came to the trees. I climbed up to the perch, and this time looked not into the distance but at the tree itself, its trunk contorted by the terrible struggle of that time when it had its hard time. After the trauma it grows less solid. It may be some such time now comes upon me. It would have to do with the unaccomplished, and with the attempted marriage of solitude and happiness. Then a rifle sounded, several times, quite loud, from across the valley, percussions of the custom of male mastery over the earth �� the most graceful, most alert of the animals being chosen to die. I looked to see if my friend had heard, but she was stepping about on her skis, studying the trees, smiling to herself, her lips still filled, for all we had drained them, with hundreds and thousands of kisses. Just then she looked up �� the way, from low to high, the god blesses �� and the blue of her eyes shone out of the black and white of bark and snow, as lovers who are walking on a freezing day touch icy cheek to icy cheek, kiss, then shudder to discover the heat waiting inside their mouths.\""

Very likely she has always understood what I have slowly learned, and which only now, after being away, almost as far away as one can get on this globe, almost as far as thoughts can carry - yet still in her presence, still surrounded not so much by reminders of her as by things she had already reminded me of, shadows of her cast forward and waiting - can I try to express: that love is hard, that while many good things are easy, true love is not, because love is first of all a power, its own power, which continually must make its way forward, from night into day, from transcending union always forward into difficult day. And as the plane descends, it comes to me in the space where tears stream down across the stars, tears fallen on the actual earth where their shining is what we call spirit, that once the lover recognizes the other, knows for the first time what is most to be valued in another, from then on, love is very much like courage, perhaps it is courage, and even perhaps only courage. Squashed out of old selves, smearing the darkness of expectation across experience, all of us little thinkers it brings home having similar thoughts of landing to the imponderable world, the transoceanic airliner, resting its huge weight down, comes in almost lightly, to where with sudden, tiny, white puffs and long, black, rubberish smears all its tires know the home ground.\""

I take a wolf's rib and whittle it sharp at both ends and coil it up and freeze it in blubber and place it out on the fairway of the bears. And when it has vanished I move out on the bear tracks, roaming in circles until I come to the first, tentative, dark splash on the earth. And I set out running, following the splashes of blood wandering over the world. At the cut, gashed resting places I stop and rest, at the crawl-marks where he lay out on his belly to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice I lie out dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists. On the third day I begin to starve, at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would at a turd sopped in blood, and hesitate, and pick it up, and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down, and rise and go on running. On the seventh day, living by now on bear blood alone, I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled, steamy hulk, the heavy fur riffling in the wind. I come up to him and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes, the dismayed face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils flared, catching perhaps the first taint of me as he died. I hack a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink, and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up after me, against the wind, and sleep. And dream of lumbering flatfooted over the tundra, stabbed twice from within, splattering a trail behind me, splattering it out no matter which way I lurch, no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence, which dance of solitude I attempt, which gravity-clutched leap, which trudge, which groan. Until one day I totter and fall - fall on this stomach that has tried so hard to keep up, to digest the blood as it leaked in, to break up and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze blows over me, blows off the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood and rotted stomach and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear, blows across my sore, lolled tongue a song or screech, until I think I must rise up and dance. And I lie still. I awaken I think. Marshlights reappear, geese come trailing again up the flyway. In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear lies, licking lumps of smeared fur and drizzly eyes into shapes with her tongue. And one hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me, the next groaned out, the next, the next, the rest of my days I spend wandering: wondering what, anyway, was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood, that poetry, by which I lived? from Body Rags, Galway Kinnell (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, ).\""

Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain. They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves: You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground, Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows- Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone. One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer. He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim. Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of going back to be. It's when I'm weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig's having lashed across it open. I'd like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over. May no fate wilfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree~ And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again. That would be good both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.\""

It is under the small, dim, summer star. I know not who these mute folk are Who share the unlit place with me- Those stones out under the low-limbed tree Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar. They are tireless folk, but slow and sad, Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,- With none among them that ever sings, And yet, in view of how many things, As sweet companions as might be had.\""

The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there, I let my neighbor know beyond the hill And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again. We keep the wall between us as we go. To each the boulders that have fallen to each. And some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance: \\\"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\\\" We wear our fingers rough with handling them. Oh, just another kind of outdoor game, One on a side. It comes to little more: There were it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine and I am apple orchard. My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. He only says, \\\"Good fences make good neighbors.\\\" Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head: \\\"Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. Before I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offense. Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That wants it down.\\\" I could say \\\"Elves\\\" to him, But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself. I see him there, Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. He moves in darkness as it seems to me, Not of woods only and the shade of trees. He will not go behind his father's saying, And he likes having though of it so well He says again, \\\"Good fences make good neighbors.\\\"\""

The gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow Its two banks have not shut upon the river But it is long ago- It seems forever- Since first I saw thee glance, WIth all thy dazzling other ones, In airy dalliance, Precipitate in love, Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above, Like a linp rose-wreath in a fairy dance. When that was, the soft mist Of my regret hung not on all the land, And I was glad for thee, And glad for me, I wist. Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high, That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind, With those great careless wings, Nor yet did I. And there were othe rthings: It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp: Then fearful he had let thee win Too far beyond him to be gathered in, Santched thee, o'ereager, with ungentle gasp. Ah! I remember me How once conspiracy was rife Against my life- The languor of it and the dreaming fond Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought, The breeze three odors brought, And a gem-flower waved in a wand! Then when I was distraught And could not speak, Sidelong, full on my cheek, What should that reckless zephyr fling But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing! I found that wing broken today! For thou art dead, I said, And the strang birds say. I found it with the withered leaves Under the eaves.\""

The bridegroom looked at the weary road, Yet saw but her within, And wished her heart in a case of gold And pinned with a silver pin.

It melted, and I let it fall and break. But I was well Upon my way to sleep before it fell, And I could tell What form my dreaming was about to take. Magnified apples appear and disappear, Stem end and blossom end, And every fleck of russet showing dear. My instep arch not only keeps the ache, It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. And I keep hearing from the cellar bin The rumbling sound Of load on load of apples coming in. For I have had too much Of apple-picking: I am overtired Of the great harvest I myself desired. There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. For all That struck the earth, No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, Went surely to the cider-apple heap As of no worth.

When she heard his step, She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage To meet him in the doorway with the news And put him on his guard. 'Silas is back.' She pushed him outward with her through the door And shut it after her. \\\"Be kind,' she said. She took the market things from Warren's arms And set them on the porch, then drew him down To sit beside her on the wooden steps. 'When was I ever anything but kind to him? But I'll not have the fellow back,' he said. 'I told him so last haying, didn't I? \\\"If he left then,\\\" I said, \\\"that ended it.\\\" What good is he? Who else will harbour him At his age for the little he can do? What help he is there's no depending on. Off he goes always when I need him most. 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, Enough at least to buy tobacco with, won't have to beg and be beholden.\\\" \\\"All right,\\\" I say \\\"I can't afford to pay Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.\\\" \\\"Someone else can.\\\" \\\"Then someone else will have to. I shouldn't mind his bettering himself If that was what it was. You can be certain, When he begins like that, there's someone at him Trying to coax him off with pocket-money, - In haying time, when any help is scarce. In winter he comes back to us. I'm done.' 'Shh I not so loud: he'll hear you,' Mary said. 'I want him to: he'll have to soon or late.' 'He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, A miserable sight, and frightening, too- You needn't smile - I didn't recognize him- I wasn't looking for him- and he's changed. Wait till you see.' 'Where did you say he'd been? 'He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. I tried to make him talk about his travels. Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.' 'What did he say? Did he say anything?' 'But little.' 'Anything? Mary, confess He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me.' 'Warren!' 'But did he? I just want to know.' 'Of course he did. What would you have him say? Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man Some humble way to save his self-respect. He added, if you really care to know, He meant to dear the upper pasture, too. That sounds like something you have heard before? Warren, I wish you could have heard the way He jumbled everything. I stopped to look Two or three times - he made me feel so queer- To see if he was talking in his sleep. He ran on Harold Wilson - you remember - The boy you had in haying four years since. He's finished school, and teaching in his college. Silas declares you'll have to get him back. He says they two will make a team for work: Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! The way he mixed that in with other things. He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft On education - you know how they fought All through July under the blazing sun, Silas up on the cart to build the load, Harold along beside to pitch it on.' 'Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.' 'Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. After so many years he still keeps finding Good arguments he sees he might have used. I sympathize. I know just how it feels To think of the right thing to say too late. Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying He studied Latin like the violin Because he liked it - that an argument! He said he couldn't make the boy believe He could find water with a hazel prong- Which showed how much good school had ever done him. He wanted to go over that. 'But most of all He thinks if he could have another chance To teach him how to build a load of hay -' 'I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. He bundles every forkful in its place, And tags and numbers it for future reference, So he can find and easily dislodge it In the unloading. Silas does that well. He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. You never see him standing on the hay He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself.' 'He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be Some good perhaps to someone in the world. He hates to see a boy the fool of books. Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, And nothing to look backward to with pride, And nothing to look forward to with hope, So now and never any different.' Part of a moon was filling down the west, Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, As if she played unheard the tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night. 'Warren,' she said, 'he has come home to die: You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time.' 'Home,' he mocked gently. 'Yes, what else but home? It all depends on what you mean by home. Of course he's nothing to us, any more then was the hound that came a stranger to us Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.' 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.' 'I should have called it Something you somehow haven't to deserve.' Warren leaned out and took a step or two, Picked up a little stick, and brought it back And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. 'Silas has better claim on' us, you think, Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles As the road winds would bring him to his door. Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, A somebody- director in the bank.' 'He never told us that.' 'We know it though.' 'I think his brother ought to help, of course. I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right To take him in, and might be willing to- He may be better than appearances. But have some pity on Silas. Do you think If he'd had any pride in claiming kin Or anything he looked for from his brother, He'd keep so still about him all this time?' 'I wonder what's between them.' 'I can tell you. Silas is what he is - we wouldn't mind him- But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. He never did a thing so very bad. He don't know why he isn't quite as good As anyone. He won't be made ashamed To please his brother, worthless though he is.' 'I can't think Si ever hurt anyone.' 'No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. You must go in and see what you can do. I made the bed up for him there to-night. You'll be surprised at him - how much he's broken. His working days are done I'm sure of it.' 'I'd not be in a hurry to say that.' 'I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. But, Warren, please remember how it is: He' come to help you ditch the meadow. He has a plan, You mustn't laugh at him. He may not speak of it, and then he may. I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud Will hit or miss the moon.' It hit the moon.Then there were three there, making a dim row, The moon, the little silver cloud, and she. Warren returned- too soon, it seemed to her, Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. 'Warren?' she questioned. 'Dead,' was all he answered.\""

As she endured it all: bore up under the swift-as-flight, the fleeting, the far-gone, the inconceivably vast, the still-to-learn, serenely as a woman carrying water moves with a full jug. Till in the midst of play, transfiguring and preparing for the future, the first white veil descended, gliding softly over her opened face, almost opaque there, never to be lifted off again, and somehow giving to all her questions just one answer: In you, who were a child once-in you.

And when they finished and it was time to stand and slowly as chance selected them they left and moved through many rooms (they talked and laughed) I saw her. She was moving far behind The others absorbed like someone who will soon have to sing before a large assembly upon her eyes which were radiant with joy light played as on the surface of a pool. She followed slowly taking a long time as though there were some obstacle in the way and yet: as though once it was overcome she would be beyond all walking and would fly.\""

From the nearby wood you hear the urgent whistling of a plover reminding you of someone's Saint Jerome: so much solitude and passion come from that one voice whose fierce request the downpour will grant. The walls with their ancient portraits glide away from us cautiously as though they weren't supposed to hear what we are saying. And reflected on the faded tapestries now: the chill uncertain sunlight of those long childhood hours when you were so afraid.\""

    "author": "Rainer Maria Rilke",
    "text": "\"The First Elegy Who if I cried out would hear me among the angels' hierarchies? and even if one of them pressed me suddenly against his heart: I would be consumed I that overwhelming existence. For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we still are just able to endure and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. Every angel is terrifying. And so I hold myself back and swallow the call-note Of my dark sobbing. Ah whom can we ever turn to in our need? Not angels not humans and already the knowing animals are aware that we are not really at home in our interpreted world. Perhaps there remains for us some tree on a hillside which every day we can take into our vision there remains for us yesterday's street and the loyalty of a habit so much at ease when it stayed with us that it moved in and never left. Oh and night: there is night when a wind full of infinite space gnaws at out faces. Whom would it not remain for-that longed-after mildly disillusioning presence which the solitary heart so painfully meets. Is it any less difficult for lovers? But they keep on using each other to hide their own fate. Don't you know yet? Fling the emptiness out of your arms Into the spaces we breathe perhaps the birds will feel the expanded air with more passionate flying. Yes-the springtime needed you. Often a star was waiting for you to notice it. A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past or as you walked under an open window a violin yielded itself to your hearing. All this was mission. But could you accomplish it? Weren't you always Distracted by expectation as if every event announced a beloved? (Where can you find a place to keep her with all the huge strange thoughts inside you going and coming and often staying all night.) But when you feel longing sing of women in love for their famous passion is still not immortal. Sing of women abandoned and desolate (you envy them almost) who could love so much more purely than those who were gratified. Begin again and again the never-attainable praising remember: the hero lives on even his downfall was merely a pretext for achieving his final birth. But Nature spent and exhausted takes lovers back into herself as if there were not enough strength to create them a second time. Have you imagined Gaspara Stampa intensely enough so that any girl deserted by her beloved might be inspired by that fierce example of soaring objectless love and might say to herself Perhaps I can be like her ? Shouldn't this most ancient suffering finally grow more fruitful for us? Isn't it time that we lovingly freed ourselves from the beloved and quivering endured: as the arrow endures the bowstring's tension so that gathered in the snap of release it can be more than itself. For there is no place where we can remain. Voices. Voices. Listen my heart as only Saints have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them off the ground yet they kept on impossibly kneeling and didn't notice at all: so complete was their listening. Not that you could endure God's voice-far from it. But listen to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message that forms itself out of silence. It is murmuring toward you now from those who died young. Didn't their fate whenever you stepped into a church In Naples or Rome quietly come to address you? Or high up some eulogy entrusted you with a mission as last year on the plaque in Santa Maria Formosa. What they want of me is that I gently remove the appearance of injustice about their death-which at times slightly hinders their souls from proceeding onward. Of course it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer to give up customs one barely had time to learn not to see roses and other promising Things in terms of a human future no longer to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands to leave even one's own first name behind forgetting it as easily as a child abandons a broken toy. Strange to no longer desire one's desires. Strange to see meanings that clung together once floating away in every direction. And being dead is hard work and full of retrieval before one can gradually feel a trace of eternity. -Though the living are wrong to believe in the too-sharp distinctions which they themselves have created. Angels (they say) don't know whether it is the living they are moving among or the dead. The eternal torrent whirls all ages along in it through both realms forever and their voices are drowned out in its thunderous roar. In the end those who were carried off early no longer need us: they are weaned from earth's sorrows and joys as gently as children outgrow the soft breasts of their mothers. But we who do need such great mysteries we for whom grief is so often the source of our spirit's growth-: could we exist without them? Is the legend meaningless that tells how in the lament for Linus the daring first notes of song pierced through the barren numbness and then in the startled space which a youth as lovely as a god had suddenly left forever the Void felt for the first time that harmony which now enraptures and comforts and helps us.\""

    "text": "\"Every angel is terrifying. And yet alas I invoked you almost deadly birds of the soul knowing about you. Where are the days of Tobias when one of you veiling his radiance stood at the front door slightly disguised for the journey no longer appalling (a young man like the one who curiously peeked through the window). But if the archangel now perilous from behind the stars took even one step down toward us: our own heart beating higher and higher would bear us to death. Who are you? Early successes Creation's pampered favorites mountain-ranges peaks growing red in the dawn of all Beginning -pollen of the flowering godhead joints of pure light corridors stairways thrones space formed from essence shields made of ecstasy storms of emotion whirled into rapture and suddenly alone: mirrors which scoop up the beauty that has streamed from their face and gather it back into themselves entire. But we when moved by deep feeling evaporate we breathe ourselves out and away from moment to moment our emotion grows fainter like a perfume. Though someone may tell us: Yes, you've entered my bloodstream, the room, the whole springtime is filled with you¡­ -what does it matter? he can't contain us we vanish inside him and around him. And those who are beautiful oh who can retain them? Appearance ceaselessly rises in their face and is gone. Like dew from the morning grass what is ours floats into the air like steam from a dish of hot food. O smile where are you going? O upturned glance: new warm receding wave on the sea of the heart¡­ alas but that is what we are. Does the infinite space we dissolve into taste of us then? Do the angels really reabsorb only the radiance that streamed out from themselves or sometimes as if by an oversight is there a trace of our essence in it as well? Are we mixed in with their features even as slightly as that vague look in the faces of pregnant women? They do not notice it (how could they notice) in their swirling return to themselves. Lovers if they knew how might utter strange marvelous Words in the night air. For it seems that everything hides us. Look: trees do exist the houses that we live in still stand. We alone fly past all things as fugitive as the wind. And all things conspire to keep silent about us half out of shame perhaps half as unutterable hope. Lovers gratified in each other I am asking you about us. You hold each other. Where is your proof? Look sometimes I find that my hands have become aware of each other or that my time-worn face shelters itself inside them. That gives me a slight sensation. But who would dare to exist just for that? You though who in the other's passion grow until overwhelmed he begs you: No more¡­ you who beneath his hands swell with abundance like autumn grapes you who may disappear because the other has wholly emerged: I am asking you about us. I know you touch so blissfully because the caress preserves because the place you so tenderly cover does not vanish because underneath it you feel pure duration. So you promise eternity almost from the embrace. And yet when you have survived the terror of the first glances the longing at the window and the first walk together once only through the garden: lovers are you the same? When you lift yourselves up to each other's mouth and your lips join drink against drink: oh how strangely each drinker seeps away from his action. Weren't you astonished by the caution of human gestures on Attic gravestones? Wasn't love and departure placed so gently on shoulders that is seemed to be made of a different substance than in our world? Remember the hands how weightlessly they rest though there is power in the torsos. These self-mastered figures know: \\\"We can go this far This is ours to touch one another this lightly the gods Can press down harder upon us. But that is the gods' affair.\\\" If only we too could discover a pure contained human place our own strip of fruit-bearing soil between river and rock. For our own heart always exceeds us as theirs did. And we can no longer follow it gazing into images that soothe it into the godlike bodies where measured more greatly if achieves a greater repose.\""

I used to pray to recover you. Ach, du. In the German tongue, in the Polish town Scraped flat by the roller Of wars, wars, wars. But the name of the town is common. My Polack friend Says there are a dozen or two. So I never could tell where you Put your foot, your root, I never could talk to you. The tongue stuck in my jaw. It stuck in a barb wire snare. Ich, ich, ich, ich, I could hardly speak. I thought every German was you. And the language obscene An engine, an engine, Chuffing me off like a Jew. A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen. I began to talk like a Jew. I think I may well be a Jew. The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna Are not very pure or true.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy, In the picture I have of you, A cleft in your chin instead of your foot But no less a devil for that, no not Any less the black man who Bit my pretty red heart in two. I was ten when they buried you. At twenty I tried to die And get back, back, back to you. I thought even the bones would do. But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue. And then I knew what to do. I made a model of you, A man in black with a Meinkampf look And a love of the rack and the screw. And I said I do, I do. So daddy, I'm finally through. The black telephone's off at the root, The voices just can't worm through. If I've killed one man, I've killed two- The vampire who said he was you And drank my blood for a year, Seven years, if you want to know. Daddy, you can lie back now.

A sandy damper kills the vibrations It stretches for miles, the shrunk voices Waving and crutchless, half their old size. The lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces, Boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner. Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses? Is it any wonder he affects a black cassock? Here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers Who wall up their backs against him. They are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body. The sea, that crystallized these, Creeps away, many-snaked, with a long hiss of distress. () This black boot has no mercy for anybody. Why should it, it is the hearse of a dad foot, The high, dead, toeless foot of this priest Who plumbs the well of his book, The bent print bulging before him like scenery. Obscene bikinis hid in the dunes, Breasts and hips a confectioner's sugar Of little crystals, titillating the light, While a green pool opens its eye, Sick with what it has swallowed- Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the concrete bunkers Two lovers unstick themselves. O white sea-crockery, What cupped sighs, what salt in the throat....

This is the side of a man: his red ribs, The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon: One mirrory eye- A facet of knowledge. On a striped mattress in one room An old man is vanishing. There is no help in his weeping wife. Where are the eye-stones, yellow and vvaluable, And the tongue, sapphire of ash. () A wedding-cake face in a paper frill. How superior he is now. It is like possessing a saint. The nurses in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful They are browning, like touched gardenias. The bed is rolled from the wall. This is what it is to be complete. It is horrible. Is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit Under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak Rises so whitely unbuffeted? They propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened And folded his hands, that were shaking: goodbye, goodbye. Now the washed sheets fly in the sun, The pillow cases are sweetening. It is a blessing, it is a blessing: The long coffin of soap-colored oak, The curious bearers and the raw date Engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm. () The gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea Run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows, The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife- Blunt, practical boats Full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters. In the parlor of the stone house One curtain is flickering from the open window, Flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle. This is the tongue of the dead man: remember, remember. How far he is now, his actions Around him like livingroom furniture, like a d�cor. As the pallors gather- The pallors of hands and neighborly faces, The elate pallors of flying iris. They are flying off into nothing: remember us. The empty benches of memory look over stones, Marble facades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils. It is so beautiful up here: it is a stopping place. () The natural fatness of these lime leaves!- Pollarded green balls, the trees march to church. The voice of the priest, in thin air, Meets the corpse at the gate, Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell A glittler of wheat and crude earth. What is the name of that color?- Old blood of caked walls the sun heals, Old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts. The widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters, Necessary among the flowers, Enfolds her lace like fine linen, Not to be spread again. While a sky, wormy with put-by smiles, Passes cloud after cloud. And the bride flowers expend a fershness, And the soul is a bride In a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless. () Behind the glass of this car The world purrs, shut-off and gentle. And I am dark-suited and stil, a member of the party, Gliding up in low gear behind the cart. And the priest is a vessel, A tarred fabric,sorry and dull, Following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman, A crest of breasts, eyelids and lips Storming the hilltop. Then, from the barred yard, the children Smell the melt of shoe-blacking, Their faces turning, wordless and slow, Their eyes opening On a wonderful thing- Six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood, And a naked mouth, red and awkward. For a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma. There is no hope, it is given up.\""

III The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. It was a small part of the pantomime. IV A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. V I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. VI Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. VII O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? VIII I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. IX When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. X At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. XI He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. XII The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. XIII It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs.\""

The water never formed to mind or voice, Like a body wholly body, fluttering Its empty sleeves and yet its mimic motion Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry, That was not ours although we understood, Inhuman, of the veritable ocean. The sea was not a mask. No more was she. The song and water were not medleyed sound Even if what she sang was what she heard. Since what she sang was uttered word by word. It may be that in all her phrases stirred The grinding water and the gasping wind But it was she and not the sea we heard. For she was the maker of the song she sang. The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea Was merely a place by which she walked to sing. Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew It was the spirit that we sought and knew That we should ask this often as she sang. If it was only the dark voice of the sea That rose, or even colored by many waves If it was only the outer voice of sky And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled, However clear, it would have been deep air, The heaving speech of air, a summer sound Repeated in a summer without end And sound alone. But it was more than that, More even than her voice, and ours, among The meaningless plungings of water and the wind, Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres Of sky and sea. It was her voice that made The sky acutest at its vanishing. She measured to the hour its solitude. She was the single artificer of the world In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea, Whatever self it had, became the self That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we, As we beheld her striding there alone, Knew that there never was a world for her Except the one she sang and, singing, made. Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know, Why, when the singing ended and we turned Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights, The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there, As night descended, tilting in the air, Mastered the night and portioned out the sea, Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles, Arranging, deepening, enchanting night. Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon, The maker's rage to order words of the sea, Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred, And of ourselves and of our origins, In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.\""

She dreams a little, and she feels the dark Encroachment of that old catastrophe, As a calm darkens among water-lights. The pungent oranges and bright, green wings Seem things in some procession of the dead, Winding across wide water, without sound. The day is like wide water, without sound, Stilled for the passion of her dreaming feet Over the seas, to silent Palestine, Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. Why should she give her bounty to the dead? What is divinity if it can come Only in silent shadows and in dreams? Shall she not find in the comforts of sun, In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else In any balm or beauty of the earth, Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? Divinity must live within herself: Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued Elations when the forest blooms gusty Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights All pleasures and all pains, remembering The bough of summer and the winter branch. These are the measures destined for her soul. Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind He moved among us, as a muttering king, Magnificent, would move among his hinds, Until our blood, commingling, virginal, With heaven, brought such requital to desire The very hinds discerned it, in a star. Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be The blood of paradise? And shall the earth Seem all of paradise that we shall know? The sky will be much friendlier then than now, A part of labor and a part of pain, And next in glory to enduring love, Not this dividing and indifferent blue. She says, \\\"I am content when wakened birds, Before they fly, test the reality Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields Return no more, where, then, is paradise?\\\" There is not any haunt of prophecy, Nor any old chimera of the grave, Neither the golden underground, nor isle Melodious, where spirits gat them home, Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm Remote as heaven's hill, that has endured As April's green endures or will endure Like her rememberance of awakened birds, Or her desire for June and evening, tipped By the consummation of the swallow's wings. She says, \\\"But in contentment I still feel The need of some imperishable bliss.\\\" Death is the mother of beauty hence from her, Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams And our desires. Although she strews the leaves Of sure obliteration on our paths, The path sick sorrow took, the many paths Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love Whispered a little out of tenderness, She makes the willow shiver in the sun For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. She causes boys to pile new plums and pears On disregarded plate. The maidens taste And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. Is there no change of death in paradise? Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, With rivers like our own that seek for seas They never find, the same receeding shores That never touch with inarticulate pang? Why set the pear upon those river-banks Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? Alas, that they should wear our colors there, The silken weavings of our afternoons, And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, Within whose burning bosom we devise Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun, Not as a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them, like a savage source. Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, Out of their blood, returning to the sky And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, The windy lake wherein their lord delights, The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, That choir among themselves long afterward. They shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn. And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feet shall manifest. She hears, upon that water without sound, A voice that cries, \\\"The tomb in Palestine Is not the porch of spirits lingering. It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\\\" We live in an old chaos of the sun, Or old dependency of day and night, Or island solitude, unsponsered, free, Of that wide water, inescapable. Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness And, in the isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make Abiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended wings.\""

No doubt we live beyond ourselves in air, In an element that does not do for us, so well, that which we do for ourselves, too big, A thing not planned for imagery or belief, Not one of the masculine myths we used to make, A transparency through which the swallow weaves, Without any form or any sense of form, What we know in what we see, what we feel in what We hear, what we are, beyond mystic disputation, In the tumult of integrations out of the sky, And what we think, a breathing like the wind, A moving part of a motion, a discovery Part of a discovery, a change part of a change, A sharing of color and being part of it.

It is like the strain Waked in the elders by Susanna Of a green evening, clear and warm, She bathed in her still garden, while The red-eyed elders, watching, felt The basses of their beings throb In witching chords, and their thin blood Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna. II In the green water, clear and warm, Susanna lay. She searched The touch of springs, And found Concealed imaginings. She sighed, For so much melody. Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions. She walked upon the grass, Still quavering. The winds were like her maids, On timid feet, Fetching her woven scarves, Yet wavering. A breath upon her hand Muted the night. She turned - A cymbal crashed, Amid roaring horns. III Soon, with a noise like tambourines, Came her attendant Byzantines. They wondered why Susanna cried Against the elders by her side And as they whispered, the refrain Was like a willow swept by rain. Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame Revealed Susanna and her shame. And then, the simpering Byzantines Fled, with a noise like tambourines. IV Beauty is momentary in the mind - The fitful tracing of a portal But in the flesh it is immortal. The body dies the body's beauty lives. So evenings die, in their green going, A wave, interminably flowing. So gardens die, their meek breath scenting The cowl of winter, done repenting. So maidens die, to the auroral Celebration of a maiden's choral. Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders but, escaping, Left only Death's ironic scraping. Now, in its immortality, it plays On the clear viol of her memory, And makes a constant sacrament of praise.\""

Sed quaeritur: is this same wig Of things, this nincompated pedagogue, Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea Created, in his day, a touch of doubt. An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes, Berries of villages, a barber's eye, An eye of land, of simple salad-beds, Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung On porpoises, instead of apricots, And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts Dibbled in waves that were mustachios, Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world. One eats one pat��, even of salt, quotha. It was not so much the lost terrestrial, The snug hibernal from that sea and salt, That century of wind in a single puff. What counted was mythology of self, Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin, The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane, The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw Of hum, inquisitorial botanist, And general lexicographer of mute And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself, A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass. What word split up in clickering syllables And storming under multitudinous tones Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt? Crispin was washed away by magnitude. The whole of life that still remained in him Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear, Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh, Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust. Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea, The old age of a watery realist, Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age That whispered to the sun's compassion, made A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars, And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that Which made him Triton, nothing left of him, Except in faint, memorial gesturings, That were like arms and shoulders in the waves, Here, something in the rise and fall of wind That seemed hallucinating horn, and here, A sunken voice, both of remembering And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain. Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved. The valet in the tempest was annulled. Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next, And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt. Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates, Dejected his manner to the turbulence. The salt hung on his spirit like a frost, The dead brine melted in him like a dew Of winter, until nothing of himself Remained, except some starker, barer self In a starker, barer world, in which the sun Was not the sun because it never shone With bland complaisance on pale parasols, Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets. Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin Became an introspective voyager. Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last, Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing, But with a speech belched out of hoary darks Noway resembling his, a visible thing, And excepting negligible Triton, free From the unavoidable shadow of himself That lay elsewhere around him. Severance Was clear. The last distortion of romance Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea Severs not only lands but also selves. Here was no help before reality. Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new. The imagination, here, could not evade, In poems of plums, the strict austerity Of one vast, subjugating, final tone. The drenching of stale lives no more fell down. What was this gaudy, gusty panoply? Out of what swift destruction did it spring? It was caparison of mind and cloud And something given to make whole among The ruses that were shattered by the large. II Concerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers Of the Caribbean amphitheatre, In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea, As if raspberry tanagers in palms, High up in orange air, were barbarous. But Crispin was too destitute to find In any commonplace the sought-for aid. He was a man made vivid by the sea, A man come out of luminous traversing, Much trumpeted, made desperately clear, Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies, To whom oracular rockings gave no rest. Into a savage color he went on. How greatly had he grown in his demesne, This auditor of insects! He that saw The stride of vanishing autumn in a park By way of decorous melancholy he That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring, As dissertation of profound delight, Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes, Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged His apprehension, made him intricate In moody rucks, and difficult and strange In all desires, his destitution's mark. He was in this as other freemen are, Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly. His violence was for aggrandizement And not for stupor, such as music makes For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived That coolness for his heat came suddenly, And only, in the fables that he scrawled With his own quill, in its indigenous dew, Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed, Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt, Green barbarism turning paradigm. Crispin foresaw a curious promenade Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate, And elemental potencies and pangs, And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen, Making the most of savagery of palms, Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread. The fabulous and its intrinsic verse Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned In radiance from the Atlantic coign, For Crispin and his quill to catechize. But they came parlaying of such an earth, So thick with sides and jagged lops of green, So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns, Scenting the jungle in their refuges, So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins, That earth was like a jostling festival Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent, Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth. So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found A new reality in parrot-squawks. Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd Discoverer walked through the harbor streets Inspecting the cabildo, the fa?ade Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed, Approaching like a gasconade of drums. The white cabildo darkened, the fa?ade, As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up In swift, successive shadows, dolefully. The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind, Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry, Came bluntly thundering, more terrible Than the revenge of music on bassoons. Gesticulating lightning, mystical, Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight. An annotator has his scruples, too. He knelt in the cathedral with the rest, This connoisseur of elemental fate, Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one Of many proclamations of the kind, Proclaiming something harsher than he learned From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights Or seeing the midsummer artifice Of heat upon his pane. This was the span Of force, the quintessential fact, the note Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own, The thing that makes him envious in phrase. And while the torrent on the roof still droned He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free And more than free, elate, intent, profound And studious of a self possessing him, That was not in him in the crusty town From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades, In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap, Let down gigantic quavers of its voice, For Crispin to vociferate again. III Approaching Carolina The book of moonlight is not written yet Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire, Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage Through sweating changes, never could forget That wakefulness or meditating sleep, In which the sulky strophes willingly Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs. Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book For the legendary moonlight that once burned In Crispin's mind above a continent. America was always north to him, A northern west or western north, but north, And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled And lank, rising and slumping from a sea Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread In endless ledges, glittering, submerged And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon. The spring came there in clinking pannicles Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came, If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening, Before the winter's vacancy returned. The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed, Was like a glacial pink upon the air. The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians, Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn. How many poems he denied himself In his observant progress, lesser things Than the relentless contact he desired How many sea-masks he ignored what sounds He shut out from his tempering ear what thoughts, Like jades affecting the sequestered bride And what descants, he sent to banishment! Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave The liaison, the blissful liaison, Between himself and his environment, Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight, For him, and not for him alone. It seemed Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, Wrong as a divagation to Peking, To him that postulated as his theme The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, A passionately niggling nightingale. Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, A minor meeting, facile, delicate. Thus he conceived his voyaging to be An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, A sally into gold and crimson forms, As on this voyage, out of goblinry, And then retirement like a turning back And sinking down to the indulgences That in the moonlight have their habitude. But let these backward lapses, if they would, Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew It was a flourishing tropic he required For his refreshment, an abundant zone, Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious Yet with a harmony not rarefied Nor fined for the inhibited instruments Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed Between a Carolina of old time, A little juvenile, an ancient whim, And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn From what he saw across his vessel's prow. He came. The poetic hero without palms Or jugglery, without regalia. And as he came he saw that it was spring, A time abhorrent to the nihilist Or searcher for the fecund minimum. The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring, Although contending featly in its veils, Irised in dew and early fragrancies, Was gemmy marionette to him that sought A sinewy nakedness. A river bore The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose, He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells Of dampened lumber, emanations blown From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes, Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks That helped him round his rude aesthetic out. He savored rankness like a sensualist. He marked the marshy ground around the dock, The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence, Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore. It purified. It made him see how much Of what he saw he never saw at all. He gripped more closely the essential prose As being, in a world so falsified, The one integrity for him, the one Discovery still possible to make, To which all poems were incident, unless That prose should wear a poem's guise at last. IV The Idea of a Colony Nota: his soil is man's intelligence. That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find. Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare His cloudy drift and planned a colony. Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex, Rex and principium, exit the whole Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose More exquisite than any tumbling verse: A still new continent in which to dwell. What was the purpose of his pilgrimage, Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind, If not, when all is said, to drive away The shadow of his fellows from the skies, And, from their stale intelligence released, To make a new intelligence prevail? Hence the reverberations in the words Of his first central hymns, the celebrants Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength Of his aesthetic, his philosophy, The more invidious, the more desired. The florist asking aid from cabbages, The rich man going bare, the paladin Afraid, the blind man as astronomer, The appointed power unwielded from disdain. His western voyage ended and began. The torment of fastidious thought grew slack, Another, still more bellicose, came on. He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena, And, being full of the caprice, inscribed Commingled souvenirs and prophecies. He made a singular collation. Thus: The natives of the rain are rainy men. Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes, And April hillsides wooded white and pink, Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears. And in their music showering sounds intone. On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote, What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore, What pulpy dram distilled of innocence, That streaking gold should speak in him Or bask within his images and words? If these rude instances impeach themselves By force of rudeness, let the principle Be plain. For application Crispin strove, Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute As the marimba, the magnolia as rose. Upon these premises propounding, he Projected a colony that should extend To the dusk of a whistling south below the south. A comprehensive island hemisphere. The man in Georgia waking among pines Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man, Planting his pristine cores in Florida, Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery, But on the banjo's categorical gut, Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays. Sepulchral se?ors, bibbing pale mescal, Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs, Should make the intricate Sierra scan. And dark Brazilians in their caf��s, Musing immaculate, pampean dits, Should scrawl a vigilant anthology, To be their latest, lucent paramour. These are the broadest instances. Crispin, Progenitor of such extensive scope, Was not indifferent to smart detail. The melon should have apposite ritual, Performed in verd apparel, and the peach, When its black branches came to bud, belle day, Should have an incantation. And again, When piled on salvers its aroma steeped The summer, it should have a sacrament And celebration. Shrewd novitiates Should be the clerks of our experience. These bland excursions into time to come, Related in romance to backward flights, However prodigal, however proud, Contained in their afflatus the reproach That first drove Crispin to his wandering. He could not be content with counterfeit, With masquerade of thought, with hapless words That must belie the racking masquerade, With fictive flourishes that preordained His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly. It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was, Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event, A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown. There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not The oncoming fantasies of better birth. The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way. All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged. But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim. Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets, With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener? No, no: veracious page on page, exact. V A Nice Shady Home Crispin as hermit, pure and capable, Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent Had kept him still the pricking realist, Choosing his element from droll confect Of was and is and shall or ought to be, Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come To colonize his polar planterdom And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee. But his emprize to that idea soon sped. Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there Slid from his continent by slow recess To things within his actual eye, alert To the difficulty of rebellious thought When the sky is blue. The blue infected will. It may be that the yarrow in his fields Sealed pensive purple under its concern. But day by day, now this thing and now that Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned, Little by little, as if the suzerain soil Abashed him by carouse to humble yet Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement. He first, as realist, admitted that Whoever hunts a matinal continent May, after all, stop short before a plum And be content and still be realist. The words of things entangle and confuse. The plum survives its poems. It may hang In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground Obliquities of those who pass beneath, Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form, Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit. So Crispin hasped on the surviving form, For him, of shall or ought to be in is. Was he to bray this in profoundest brass Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems? Was he to company vastest things defunct With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky? Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong His active force in an inactive dirge, Which, let the tall musicians call and call, Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds? Because he built a cabin who once planned Loquacious columns by the ructive sea? Because he turned to salad-beds again? Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape? Should he lay by the personal and make Of his own fate an instance of all fate? What is one man among so many men? What are so many men in such a world? Can one man think one thing and think it long? Can one man be one thing and be it long? The very man despising honest quilts Lies quilted to his poll in his despite. For realists, what is is what should be. And so it came, his cabin shuffled up, His trees were planted, his duenna brought Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands, The curtains flittered and the door was closed. Crispin, magister of a single room, Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down It was as if the solitude concealed And covered him and his congenial sleep. So deep a sound fell down it grew to be A long soothsaying silence down and down. The crickets beat their tambours in the wind, Marching a motionless march, custodians. In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod, Each day, still curious, but in a round Less prickly and much more condign than that He once thought necessary. Like Candide, Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight, And cream for the fig and silver for the cream, A blonde to tip the silver and to taste The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries! Yet the quotidian saps philosophers And men like Crispin like them in intent, If not in will, to track the knaves of thought. But the quotidian composed as his, Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves, The tomtit and the cassia and the rose, Although the rose was not the noble thorn Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet, Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights In which those frail custodians watched, Indifferent to the tepid summer cold, While he poured out upon the lips of her That lay beside him, the quotidian Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner. For all it takes it gives a humped return Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed. VI And Daughters with Curls Portentous enunciation, syllable To blessed syllable affined, and sound Bubbling felicity in cantilene, Prolific and tormenting tenderness Of music, as it comes to unison, Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur His grand pronunciamento and devise. The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed, Hands without touch yet touching poignantly, Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee, Prophetic joint, for its diviner young. The return to social nature, once begun, Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute, Involved him in midwifery so dense His cabin counted as phylactery, Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt Of children nibbling at the sugared void, Infants yet eminently old, then dome And halidom for the unbraided femes, Green crammers of the green fruits of the world, Bidders and biders for its ecstasies, True daughters both of Crispin and his clay. All this with many mulctings of the man, Effective colonizer sharply stopped In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom. But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex The stopper to indulgent fatalist Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant, She seemed, of a country of the capuchins, So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed, Attentive to a coronal of things Secret and singular. Second, upon A second similar counterpart, a maid Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake Excepting to the motherly footstep, but Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep. Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light, A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth, Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified, All din and gobble, blasphemously pink. A few years more and the vermeil capuchin Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was, The dulcet omen fit for such a house. The second sister dallying was shy To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself Out of her botches, hot embosomer. The third one gaping at the orioles Lettered herself demurely as became A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody. The fourth, pent now, a digit curious. Four daughters in a world too intricate In the beginning, four blithe instruments Of differing struts, four voices several In couch, four more person?, intimate As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue That should be silver, four accustomed seeds Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights That spread chromatics in hilarious dark, Four questioners and four sure answerers. Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout. The world, a turnip once so readily plucked, Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main, And sown again by the stiffest realist, Came reproduced in purple, family font, The same insoluble lump. The fatalist Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw, Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote Invented for its pith, not doctrinal In form though in design, as Crispin willed, Disguised pronunciamento, summary, Autumn's compendium, strident in itself But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved In those portentous accents, syllables, And sounds of music coming to accord Upon his law, like their inherent sphere, Seraphic proclamations of the pure Delivered with a deluging onwardness. Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote Is false, if Crispin is a profitless Philosopher, beginning with green brag, Concluding fadedly, if as a man Prone to distemper he abates in taste, Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure, Glozing his life with after-shining flicks, Illuminating, from a fancy gorged By apparition, plain and common things, Sequestering the fluster from the year, Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops, And so distorting, proving what he proves Is nothing, what can all this matter since The relation comes, benignly, to its end? So may the relation of each man be clipped.\""

Earth that nourished thee shall claim Thy growth to be resolved to earth again And lost each human trace surrendering up Thine individual being shalt thou go To mix forever with the elements To be a brother to the insensible rock And to the sluggish clod which the rude swain Turns with his share and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world ��with kings The powerful of the earth ��the wise the good Fair forms and hoary seers of ages past All in one mighty sepulchre.

    "text": "\"THE GROVES were God's first temples. Ere man learned To hew the shaft and lay the architrave And spread the roof above them��ere he framed The lofty vault to gather and roll back The sound of anthems in the darkling wood Amidst the cool and silence he knelt down And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks And supplication. For his simple heart Might not resist the sacred influences Which from the stilly twilight of the place And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven Mingled their mossy boughs and from the sound Of the invisible breath that swayed at once All their green tops stole over him and bowed His spirit with the thought of boundless power And inaccessible majesty. Ah why Should we in the world's riper years neglect God's ancient sanctuaries and adore Only among the crowd and under roofs That our frail hands have raised? Let me at least Here in the shadow of this aged wood Offer one hymn��thrice happy if it find Acceptance in His ear. Father thy hand Hath reared these venerable columns thou Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down Upon the naked earth and forthwith rose All these fair ranks of trees. They in thy sun Budded and shook their green leaves in thy breeze And shot towards heaven. The century-living crow Whose birth was in their tops grew old and died Among their branches till at last they stood As now they stand massy and tall and dark Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold Communion with his Maker. These dim vaults These winding aisles of human pomp or pride Report not. No fantastic carvings show The boast of our vain race to change the form Of thy fair works. But thou art here��thou fill'st The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds That run along the summit of these trees In music thou art in the cooler breath That from the inmost darkness of the place Comes scarcely felt the barky trunks the ground The fresh moist ground are all instinct with thee. Here is continual worship��Nature here In the tranquillity that thou dost love Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly around From perch to perch the solitary bird Passes and yon clear spring that midst its herbs Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots Of half the mighty forest tells no tale Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left Thyself without a witness in these shades Of thy perfections. Grandeur strength and grace Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak �� By whose immovable stem I stand and seem Almost annihilated��not a prince In all that proud old world beyond the deep E'er wore his crown as loftily as he Wears the green coronal of leaves with which Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root Is beauty such as blooms not in the glare Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower With scented breath and look so like a smile Seems as it issues from the shapeless mould An emanation of the indwelling Life A visible token of the upholding Love That are the soul of this great universe. My heart is awed within me when I think Of the great miracle that still goes on In silence round me��the perpetual work Of thy creation finished yet renewed Forever. Written on thy works I read The lesson of thy own eternity. Lo! all grow old and die��but see again How on the faltering footsteps of decay Youth presses ��ever-gay and beautiful youth In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees Wave not less proudly that their ancestors Moulder beneath them. O there is not lost One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet After the flight of untold centuries The freshness of her far beginning lies And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate Of his arch-enemy Death��yea seats himself Upon the tyrant's throne��the sepulchre And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth From thine own bosom and shall have no end. There have been holy men who hid themselves Deep in the woody wilderness and gave Their lives to thought and prayer till they outlived The generation born with them nor seemed Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks Around them��and there have been holy men Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus. But let me often to these solitudes Retire and in thy presence reassure My feeble virtue. Here its enemies The passions at thy plainer footsteps shrink And tremble and are still. O God! when thou Dost scare the world with tempests set on fire The heavens with falling thunderbolts or fill With all the waters of the firmament The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods And drowns the villages when at thy call Uprises the great deep and throws himself Upon the continent and overwhelms Its cities��who forgets not at the sight Of these tremendous tokens of thy power His pride and lays his strifes and follies by? O from these sterner aspects of thy face Spare me and mine nor let us need the wrath Of the mad unchain��d elements to teach Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate In these calm shades thy milder majesty And to the beautiful order of thy works Learn to conform the order of our lives.\""

Where are the flowers the fair young flowers that lately sprang and stood In brighter light and softer airs a beauteous sisterhood? Alas! they all are in their graves the gentle race of flowers Are lying in their lowly beds with the fair and good of ours. The rain is falling where they lie but the cold November rain Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again. The wind-flower and the violet they perished long ago And the brier-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow But on the hill the goldenrod and the aster in the wood And the blue sunflower by the brook in autumn beauty stood Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven as falls the plague on men And the brightness of their smile was gone from upland glade and glen. And now when comes the calm mild day as still such days will come To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home When the sound of dropping nuts is heard though all the trees are still And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more. And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side. In the cold moist earth we laid her when the forests cast the leaf And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief: Yet not unmeet it was that one like that young friend of ours So gentle and so beautiful should perish with the flowers.\""

Then sweet the hour that brings release From danger and from toil We talk the battle over And share the battle's spoil. The woodland rings with laugh and shout As if a hunt were up And woodland flowers are gathered To crown the soldier's cup. With merry songs we mock the wind That in the pine-top grieves And slumber long and sweetly On beds of oaken leaves. Well knows the fair and friendly moon The band that Marion leads�� The glitter of their rifles The scampering of their steeds.

She met the hosts of Sorrow with a look That altered not beneath the frown they wore And soon the lowering brood were tamed and took Meekly her gentle rule and frowned no more. Her soft hand put aside the assaults of wrath And calmly broke in twain The fiery shafts of pain And rent the nets of passion from her path. By that victorious hand despair was slain. With love she vanquished hate and overcame Evil with good in her Great Master's name.

Buds which the breath of summer days Shall lengthen into leafy sprays Boughs where the thrush with crimson breast Shall haunt and sing and hide her nest We plant upon the sunny lea A shadow for the noontide hour A shelter from the summer shower When we plant the apple-tree.

Each year shall give this apple-tree A broader flush of roseate bloom A deeper maze of verdurous gloom And loosen when the frost-clouds lower The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower The years shall come and pass but we Shall hear no longer where we lie The summer's songs the autumn's sigh In the boughs of the apple-tree. And time shall waste this apple-tree. Oh when its aged branches throw Thin shadows on the ground below Shall fraud and force and iron will Oppress the weak and helpless still?

Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste Stream down the snows, till the air is white, As, myriads by myriads madly chased, They fling themselves from their shadowy height.

Yet look again, for the clouds divide A gleam of blue on the water lies And far away, on the mountain-side, A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.

The atmosphere is not a perfume��it has no taste of the distillation��it is odorless It is for my mouth forever��I am in love with it I will go to the bank by the wood, and become undisguised and naked I am mad for it to be in contact with me. The smoke of my own breath Echoes, ripples, buzz��d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore, and dark-color��d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn The sound of the belch��d words of my voice, words loos��d to the eddies of the wind A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun. Have you reckon��d a thousand acres much? have you reckon��d the earth much? Have you practis��d so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? Stop this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all poems You shall possess the good of the earth and sun��(there are millions of suns left) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me: You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from yourself. I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. There was never any more inception than there is now, Nor any more youth or age than there is now And will never be any more perfection than there is now, Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now. Urge, and urge, and urge Always the procreant urge of the world. Out of the dimness opposite equals advance��always substance and increase, always sex Always a knit of identity��always distinction��always a breed of life. To elaborate is no avail��learn��d and unlearn��d feel that it is so. Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams, Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, I and this mystery, here we stand. Clear and sweet is my Soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my Soul. Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen, Till that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its turn. Showing the best, and dividing it from the worst, age vexes age Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself. Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest. I am satisfied��I see, dance, laugh, sing: As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day, with stealthy tread, Leaving me baskets cover��d with white towels, swelling the house with their plenty, Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and scream at my eyes, That they turn from gazing after and down the road, And forthwith cipher and show me a cent, Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is ahead? Trippers and askers surround me People I meet��the effect upon me of my early life, or the ward and city I live in, or the nation, The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new, My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues, The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love, The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or ill-doing, or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events These come to me days and nights, and go from me again, But they are not the Me myself. Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, Looking with side-curved head, curious what will come next Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering at it. Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders I have no mockings or arguments��I witness and wait. I believe in you, my Soul��the other I am must not abase itself to you And you must not be abased to the other. Loafe with me on the grass��loose the stop from your throat Not words, not music or rhyme I want��not custom or lecture, not even the best Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice. I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning How you settled your head athwart my hips, and gently turn��d over upon me, And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, And reach��d till you felt my beard, and reach��d till you held my feet. Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own, And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers And that a kelson of the creation is love And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields And brown ants in the little wells beneath them And mossy scabs of the worm fence, and heap��d stones, elder, mullen and poke-weed. A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he. I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt, Bearing the owner��s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say, Whose? Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation. Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, Growing among black folks as among white Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same. And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves. Tenderly will I use you, curling grass It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men It may be if I had known them I would have loved them It may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon out of their mothers�� laps And here you are the mothers�� laps. This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers Darker than the colorless beards of old men Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths. O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues! And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing. I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps. What do you think has become of the young and old men? And what do you think has become of the women and children? They are alive and well somewhere The smallest sprout shows there is really no death And if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it, And ceas��d the moment life appear��d. All goes onward and outward��nothing collapses And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier. Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it. I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash��d babe, and am not contain��d between my hat and boots And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good The earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good. I am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself (They do not know how immortal, but I know.) Every kind for itself and its own��for me mine, male and female For me those that have been boys, and that love women For me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted For me the sweet-heart and the old maid��for me mothers, and the mothers of mothers For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears For me children, and the begetters of children. Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away. The little one sleeps in its cradle I lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand. The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill I peeringly view them from the top. The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair��I note where the pistol has fallen. The blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor The snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous��d mobs The flap of the curtain��d litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall The excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes What groans of over-fed or half-starv��d who fall sun-struck, or in fits What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to babes What living and buried speech is always vibrating here��what howls restrain��d by decorum Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips I mind them or the show or resonance of them��I come, and I depart. The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged The armfuls are pack��d to the sagging mow. I am there��I help��I came stretch��d atop of the load I felt its soft jolts��one leg reclined on the other I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy, And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps. Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt, Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night, Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill��d game Falling asleep on the gather��d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side. The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails��she cuts the sparkle and scud My eyes settle the land��I bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the deck. The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me I tuck��d my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time: (You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.) I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west��the bride was a red girl Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking��they had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders On a bank lounged the trapper��he was drest mostly in skins��his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck��he held his bride by the hand She had long eyelashes��her head was bare��her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach��d to her feet. The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak, And went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him, And brought water, and fill��d a tub for his sweated body and bruis��d feet, And gave him a room that enter��d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes, And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness, And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass��d north (I had him sit next me at table��my fire-lock lean��d in the corner.) Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly: Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome. She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window. Which of the young men does she like the best? Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her. Where are you off to, lady? for I see you You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room. Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them. The beards of the young men glisten��d with wet, it ran from their long hair: Little streams pass��d all over their bodies. An unseen hand also pass��d over their bodies It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs. The young men float on their backs��their white bellies bulge to the sun��they do not ask who seizes fast to them They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch They do not think whom they souse with spray. The butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market I loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down. Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil Each has his main-sledge��they are all out��(there is a great heat in the fire.) From the cinder-strew��d threshold I follow their movements The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms Over-hand the hammers swing��over-hand so slow��over-hand so sure: They do not hasten��each man hits in his place. The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses��the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain The negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard��steady and tall he stands, pois��d on one leg on the string-piece His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band His glance is calm and commanding��he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache��falls on the black of his polish��d and perfect limbs. I behold the picturesque giant, and love him��and I do not stop there I go with the team also. In me the caresser of life wherever moving��backward as well as forward slueing To niches aside and junior bending. Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that you express in your eyes? It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life. My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble They rise together��they slowly circle around. I believe in those wing��d purposes, And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me, And consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me. The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation (The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.) The sharp-hoof��d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog, The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats, The brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings I see in them and myself the same old law. The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections They scorn the best I can do to relate them. I am enamour��d of growing out-doors, Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods, Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out. What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me Not asking the sky to come down to my good will Scattering it freely forever. The pure contralto sings in the organ loft The carpenter dresses his plank��the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner The pilot seizes the king-pin��he heaves down with a strong arm The mate stands braced in the whale-boat��lance and harpoon are ready The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches The deacons are ordain��d with cross��d hands at the altar The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel The farmer stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-day loafe, and looks at the oats and rye The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, a confirm��d case, (He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother��s bed-room) The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case, He turns his quid of tobacco, while his eyes blurr with the manuscript The malform��d limbs are tied to the surgeon��s table, What is removed drops horribly in a pail The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand��the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove The machinist rolls up his sleeves��the policeman travels his beat��the gate-keeper marks who pass The young fellow drives the express-wagon��(I love him, though I do not know him) The half-breed straps on his light boots to complete in the race The western turkey-shooting draws old and young��some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs, Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof��d garret, and harks to the musical rain The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm��d cloth, is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat, the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers The young sister holds out the skein, while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots The one-year wife is recovering and happy, having a week ago borne her first child The clean-hair��d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine, or in the factory or mill The nine months�� gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer��the reporter��s lead flies swiftly over the note-book��the sign-painter is lettering with red and gold The canal boy trots on the tow-path��the book-keeper counts at his desk��the shoemaker waxes his thread The conductor beats time for the band, and all the performers follow him The child is baptized��the convert is making his first professions The regatta is spread on the bay��the race is begun��how the white sails sparkle! The drover, watching his drove, sings out to them that would stray The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent) The camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit for her daguerreotype The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open��d lips The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths, nor jeer you) The President, holding a cabinet council, is surrounded by the Great Secretaries On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold The Missourian crosses the plains, toting his wares and his cattle As the fare-collector goes through the train, he gives notice by the jingling of loose change The floor-men are laying the floor��the tinners are tinning the roof��the masons are calling for mortar In single file, each shouldering his hod, pass onward the laborers Seasons pursuing each other, the indescribable crowd is gather��d��it is the Fourth of Seventh-month��(What salutes of cannon and small arms!) Seasons pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe Flatboatmen make fast, towards dusk, near the cottonwood or pekan-trees Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river, or through those drain��d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansaw Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahoochee or Altamahaw Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day��s sport The city sleeps, and the country sleeps The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps by his wife And these one and all tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them And such as it is to be of these, more or less, I am. I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise Regardless of others, ever regardful of others, Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, Stuff��d with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff��d with the stuff that is fine One of the Great Nation, the nation of many nations, the smallest the same, and the largest the same A southerner soon as a northerner��a planter nonchalant and hospitable, down by the Oconee I live A Yankee, bound by my own way, ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth, and the sternest joints on earth A Kentuckian, walking the vale of the Elkhorn, in my deer-skin leggings��a Louisianian or Georgian A boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts��a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye At home on Kanadian snow-shoes, or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking At home on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch Comrade of Californians��comrade of free north-westerners, (loving their big proportions) Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen��comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest A novice beginning, yet experient of myriads of seasons Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker A prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest. I resist anything better than my own diversity I breathe the air, but leave plenty after me, And am not stuck up, and am in my place. (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are in their place The palpable is in its place, and the impalpable is in its place.) These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands��they are not original with me If they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing If they are not the riddle, and the untying of the riddle, they are nothing If they are not just as close as they are distant, they are nothing. This is the grass that grows wherever the land is, and the water is This is the common air that bathes the globe. With music strong I come��with my cornets and my drums, I play not marches for accepted victors only��I play great marches for conquer��d and slain persons. Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? I also say it is good to fall��battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won. I beat and pound for the dead I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them. Vivas to those who have fail��d! And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! And to those themselves who sank in the sea! And to all generals that lost engagements! and all overcome heroes! And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the greatest heroes known. This is the meal equally set��this is the meat for natural hunger It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous��I make appointments with all I will not have a single person slighted or left away The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited The heavy-lipp��d slave is invited��the venerealee is invited: There shall be no difference between them and the rest. This is the press of a bashful hand��this is the float and odor of hair This is the touch of my lips to yours��this is the murmur of yearning This is the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face This is the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again. Do you guess I have some intricate purpose? Well, I have��for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has. Do you take it I would astonish? Does the daylight astonish? Does the early redstart, twittering through the woods? Do I astonish more than they? This hour I tell things in confidence I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you. Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat? What is a man, anyhow? What am I? What are you? All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own Else it were time lost listening to me. I do not snivel that snivel the world over, That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare crape, and tears. Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids��conformity goes to the fourth-remov��d I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out. Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious? Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsell��d with doctors, and calculated close, I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones. In all people I see myself��none more, and not one a barleycorn less And the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them. And I know I am solid and sound To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means. I know I am deathless I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter��s compass I know I shall not pass like a child��s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night. I know I am august I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood I see that the elementary laws never apologize (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.) I exist as I am��that is enough If no other in the world be aware, I sit content And if each and all be aware, I sit content. One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million years, I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait. My foothold is tenon��d and mortis��d in granite I laugh at what you call dissolution And I know the amplitude of time. I am the poet of the Body And I am the poet of the Soul. The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me The first I graft and increase upon myself��the latter I translate into a new tongue. I am the poet of the woman the same as the man And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men. I chant the chant of dilation or pride We have had ducking and deprecating about enough I show that size is only development. Have you outstript the rest? Are you the President? It is a trifle��they will more than arrive there, every one, and still pass on. I am he that walks with the tender and growing night I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the night. Press close, bare-bosom��d night! Press close, magnetic, nourishing night! Night of south winds! night of the large few stars! Still, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night. Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breath��d earth! Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees Earth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains, misty-topt! Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with blue! Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river! Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clearer for my sake! Far-swooping elbow��d earth! rich, apple-blossom��d earth! Smile, for your lover comes! Prodigal, you have given me love! Therefore I to you give love! O unspeakable, passionate love! You sea! I resign myself to you also��I guess what you mean I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me We must have a turn together��I undress��hurry me out of sight of the land Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse Dash me with amorous wet��I can repay you. Sea of stretch��d ground-swells! Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths! Sea of the brine of life! sea of unshovell��d yet always-ready graves! Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty sea! I am integral with you��I too am of one phase, and of all phases. Partaker of influx and efflux I��extoller of hate and conciliation Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in each others�� arms. I am he attesting sympathy (Shall I make my list of things in the house, and skip the house that supports them?) I am not the poet of goodness only��I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also. Washes and razors for foofoos��for me freckles and a bristling beard. What blurt is this about virtue and about vice? Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me��I stand indifferent My gait is no fault-finder��s or rejecter��s gait I moisten the roots of all that has grown. Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy? Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work��d over and rectified? I find one side a balance, and the antipodal side a balance Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine Thoughts and deeds of the present, our rouse and early start. This minute that comes to me over the past decillions, There is no better than it and now. What behaved well in the past, or behaves well to-day, is not such a wonder The wonder is, always and always, how there can be a mean man or an infidel. Endless unfolding of words of ages! And mine a word of the modern��the word En-Masse. A word of the faith that never balks Here or henceforward, it is all the same to me��I accept Time, absolutely. It alone is without flaw��it rounds and completes all That mystic, baffling wonder I love, alone completes all. I accept reality, and dare not question it Materialism first and last imbuing. Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration! Fetch stonecrop, mixt with cedar and branches of lilac This is the lexicographer��this the chemist��this made a grammar of the old cartouches These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas This is the geologist��this works with the scalpel��and this is a mathematician. Gentlemen! to you the first honors always: Your facts are useful and real��and yet they are not my dwelling (I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.) Less the reminders of properties told, my words And more the reminders, they, of life untold, and of freedom and extrication, And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt, And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives, and them that plot and conspire. Walt Whitman am I, a Kosmos, of mighty Manhattan the son, Turbulent, fleshy and sensual, eating, drinking and breeding No sentimentalist��no stander above men and women, or apart from them No more modest than immodest. Unscrew the locks from the doors! Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs! Whoever degrades another degrades me And whatever is done or said returns at last to me. Through me the afflatus surging and surging��through me the current and index. I speak the pass-word primeval��I give the sign of democracy By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms. Through me many long dumb voices Voices of the interminable generations of slaves Voices of prostitutes, and of deform��d persons Voices of the diseas��d and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, And of the threads that connect the stars��and of wombs, and of the father-stuff, And of the rights of them the others are down upon Of the trivial, flat, foolish, despised, Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung. Through me forbidden voices Voice of sexes and lusts��voices veil��d, and I remove the veil Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigur��d. I do not press my fingers across my mouth I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart Copulation is no more rank to me than death is. I believe in the flesh and the appetites Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle. Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch��d from The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds. If I worship one thing more than another, it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it. Translucent mould of me, it shall be you! Shaded ledges and rests, it shall be you! Firm masculine colter, it shall be you. Whatever goes to the tilth of me, it shall be you! You my rich blood! Your milky stream, pale strippings of my life. Breast that presses against other breasts, it shall be you! My brain, it shall be your occult convolutions. Root of wash��d sweet flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you! Mix��d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you! Trickling sap of maple! fibre of manly wheat! it shall be you! Sun so generous, it shall be you! Vapors lighting and shading my face, it shall be you! You sweaty brooks and dews, it shall be you! Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me, it shall be you! Broad, muscular fields! branches of live oak! loving lounger in my winding paths! it shall be you! Hands I have taken��face I have kiss��d��mortal I have ever touch��d! it shall be you. I dote on myself��there is that lot of me, and all so luscious Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills me with joy. O I am wonderful! I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again. That I walk up my stoop! I pause to consider if it really be A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books. To behold the day-break! The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows The air tastes good to my palate. Hefts of the moving world, at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding, Scooting obliquely high and low. Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven. The earth by the sky staid with��the daily close of their junction The heav��d challenge from the east that moment over my head The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master! Dazzling and tremendous, how quick the sun-rise would kill me, If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me. We also ascend, dazzling and tremendous as the sun We found our own, O my Soul, in the calm and cool of the daybreak. My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds, and volumes of worlds. Speech is the twin of my vision��it is unequal to measure itself It provokes me forever It says sarcastically, Walt, you contain enough��why don��t you let it out, then? Come now, I will not be tantalized��you conceive too much of articulation. Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded? Waiting in gloom, protected by frost The dirt receding before my prophetical screams I underlying causes, to balance them at last My knowledge my live parts��it keeping tally with the meaning of things, HAPPINESS��which, whoever hears me, let him or her set out in search of this day. My final merit I refuse you��I refuse putting from me what I really am Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you. Writing and talk do not prove me I carry the plenum of proof, and everything else, in my face With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic. I think I will do nothing now but listen, To accrue what I hear into myself��to let sounds contribute toward me. I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following Sounds of the city, and sounds out of the city��sounds of the day and night Talkative young ones to those that like them��the loud laugh of work-people at their meals The angry base of disjointed friendship��the faint tones of the sick The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence The heave��e��yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves��the refrain of the anchor-lifters The ring of alarm-bells��the cry of fire��the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts, with premonitory tinkles, and color��d lights The steam-whistle��the solid roll of the train of approaching cars The slow-march play��d at the head of the association, marching two and two, (They go to guard some corpse��the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.) I hear the violoncello (��tis the young man��s heart��s complaint) I hear the key��d cornet��it glides quickly in through my ears It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast. I hear the chorus��it is a grand opera Ah, this indeed is music! This suits me. A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full. I hear the train��d soprano��(what work, with hers, is this?) The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies It wrenches such ardors from me, I did not know I possess��d them It sails me��I dab with bare feet��they are lick��d by the indolent waves I am exposed, cut by bitter and angry hail��I lose my breath, Steep��d amid honey��d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles, And that we call BEING. To be, in any form��what is that? (Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither) If nothing lay more develop��d, the quahaug in its callous shell were enough. Mine is no callous shell I have instant conductors all over me, whether I pass or stop They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me. I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy To touch my person to some one else��s is about as much as I can stand. Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity, Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them, My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs, Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip, Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, Depriving me of my best, as for a purpose, Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist, Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields, Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, They bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze at the edges of me No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while, Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me. The sentries desert every other part of me They have left me helpless to a red marauder They all come to the headland, to witness and assist against me. I am given up by traitors I talk wildly��I have lost my wits��I and nobody else am the greatest traitor I went myself first to the headland��my own hands carried me there. You villian touch! what are you doing? My breath is tight in its throat Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for me. Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath��d, hooded, sharp-tooth��d touch! Did it make you ache so, leaving me? Parting, track��d by arriving��perpetual payment of perpetual loan Rich, showering rain, and recompense richer afterward. Sprouts take and accumulate��stand by the curb prolific and vital: Landscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden. All truths wait in all things They neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist it They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon The insignificant is as big to me as any (What is less or more than a touch?) Logic and sermons never convince The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul. Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so Only what nobody denies is so. A minute and a drop of me settle my brain I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps, And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman, And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other, And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, And until every one shall delight us, and we them. I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars, And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And the tree-toad is a chef-d��oeuvre for the highest, And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, And the cow crunching with depress��d head surpasses any statue, And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels, And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer��s girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake. I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, And am stucco��d with quadrupeds and birds all over, And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons, And call anything close again, when I desire it. In vain the speeding or shyness In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder��d bones In vain objects stand leagues off, and assume manifold shapes In vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great monsters lying low In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods In vain the razor-bill��d auk sails far north to Labrador I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff. I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain��d I stand and look at them long and long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God Not one is dissatisfied��not one is demented with the mania of owning things Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth. So they show their relations to me, and I accept them They bring me tokens of myself��they evince them plainly in their possession. I wonder where they get those tokens: Did I pass that way huge times ago, and negligently drop them? Myself moving forward then and now and forever, Gathering and showing more always and with velocity, Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms. A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses, Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears, Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground, Eyes full of sparkling wickedness��ears finely cut, flexibly moving. His nostrils dilate, as my heels embrace him His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we race around and return. I but use you a moment, then I resign you, stallion Why do I need your paces, when I myself out-gallop them? Even, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you. O swift wind! O space and time! now I see it is true, what I guessed at What I guess��d when I loaf��d on the grass What I guess��d while I lay alone in my bed, And again as I walk��d the beach under the paling stars of the morning. My ties and ballasts leave me��I travel��I sail��my elbows rest in the sea-gaps I skirt the sierras��my palms cover continents I am afoot with my vision. By the city��s quadrangular houses��in log huts��camping with lumbermen Along the ruts of the turnpike��along the dry gulch and rivulet bed Weeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips��crossing savannas��trailing in forests Prospecting��gold-digging��girdling the trees of a new purchase Scorch��d ankle-deep by the hot sand��hauling my boat down the shallow river Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead��where the buck turns furiously at the hunter Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock��where the otter is feeding on fish Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey��where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail Over the growing sugar��over the yellow-flower��d cotton plant��over the rice in its low moist field Over the sharp-peak��d farm house, with its scallop��d scum and slender shoots from the gutters Over the western persimmon��over the long-leav��d corn��over the delicate blue-flower flax Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs Walking the path worn in the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve��where the great gold-bug drops through the dark Where flails keep time on the barn floor Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen��where andirons straddle the hearth-slab��where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters Where trip-hammers crash��where the press is whirling its cylinders Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself, and looking composedly down) Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose��where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand Where the she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water Where the half-burn��d brig is riding on unknown currents, Where shells grow to her slimy deck��where the dead are corrupting below Where the dense-starr��d flag is borne at the head of the regiments Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance Upon a door-step��upon the horse-block of hard wood outside Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good game of base-ball At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter At the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw At apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings: Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard��where the dry-stalks are scattered��where the brood-cow waits in the hovel Where the bull advances to do his masculine work��where the stud to the mare��where the cock is treading the hen Where the heifers browse��where geese nip their food with short jerks Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near Where the humming-bird shimmers��where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high weeds Where band-neck��d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out Where burial coaches enter the arch��d gates of a cemetery Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees Where the yellow-crown��d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs Through the gymnasium��through the curtain��d saloon��through the office or public hall Pleas��d with the native, and pleas��d with the foreign��pleas��d with the new and old Pleas��d with women, the homely as well as the handsome Pleas��d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously Pleas��d with the tune of the choir of the white-wash��d church Pleas��d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any preacher��impress��d seriously at the camp-meeting: Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon��flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate-glass Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn��d up to the clouds, My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle: Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek��d bush-boy��(behind me he rides at the drape of the day) Far from the settlements, studying the print of animals�� feet, or the moccasin print By the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a feverish patient Nigh the coffin��d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle: Voyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while Walking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side Speeding through space��speeding through heaven and the stars Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles Speeding with tail��d meteors��throwing fire-balls like the rest Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing I tread day and night such roads. I visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product: And look at quintillions ripen��d, and look at quintillions green. I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul My course runs below the soundings of plummets. I help myself to material and immaterial No guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me. I anchor my ship for a little while only My messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me. I go hunting polar furs and the seal��leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff��clinging to topples of brittle and blue. I ascend to the foretruck I take my place late at night in the crow��s-nest We sail the arctic sea��it is plenty light enough Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty The enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them��the scenery is plain in all directions The white-topt mountains show in the distance��I fling out my fancies toward them (We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment��we pass with still feet and caution Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin��d city The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.) I am a free companion��I bivouac by invading watchfires. I turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips. My voice is the wife��s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs They fetch my man��s body up, dripping and drown��d. I understand the large hearts of heroes, The courage of present times and all times How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights, And chalk��d in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you: How he follow��d with them, and tack��d with them��and would not give it up How he saved the drifting company at last: How the lank loose-gown��d women look��d when boated from the side of their prepared graves How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp��d unshaved men: All this I swallow��it tastes good��I like it well��it becomes mine I am the man��I suffer��d��I was there. The disdain and calmness of olden martyrs The mother, condemn��d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover��d with sweat The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck��the murderous buckshot and the bullets All these I feel, or am. I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs, Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn��d with the ooze of my skin I fall on the weeds and stones The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, Taunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks. Agonies are one of my changes of garments I do not ask the wounded person how he feels��I myself become the wounded person My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe. I am the mash��d fireman with breast-bone broken Tumbling walls buried me in their debris Heat and smoke I inspired��I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels They have clear��d the beams away��they tenderly lift me forth. I lie in the night air in my red shirt��the pervading hush is for my sake Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy White and beautiful are the faces around me��the heads are bared of their fire-caps The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches. Distant and dead resuscitate They show as the dial or move as the hands of me��I am the clock myself. I am an old artillerist��I tell of my fort��s bombardment I am there again. Again the long roll of the drummers Again the attacking cannon, mortars Again, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive. I take part��I see and hear the whole The cries, curses, roar��the plaudits for well-aim��d shots The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs The fall of grenades through the rent roof��the fan-shaped explosion The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air. Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general��he furiously waves with his hand He gasps through the clot, Mind not me��mind��the entrenchments. Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth (I tell not the fall of Alamo, Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo, The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo) ��Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men. Retreating, they had form��d in a hollow square, with their baggage for breastworks Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy��s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv��d writing and seal, gave up their arms, and march��d back prisoners of war. They were the glory of the race of rangers Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship, Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate, Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters, Not a single one over thirty years of age. The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and massacred��it was beautiful early summer The work commenced about five o��clock, and was over by eight. None obey��d the command to kneel Some made a mad and helpless rush��some stood stark and straight A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart��the living and dead lay together The maim��d and mangled dug in the dirt��the newcomers saw them there Some, half-kill��d, attempted to crawl away These were despatch��d with bayonets, or batter��d with the blunts of muskets A youth not seventeen years old seiz��d his assassin till two more came to release him The three were all torn, and cover��d with the boy��s blood. At eleven o��clock began the burning of the bodies: That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men. Would you hear of an old-fashion��d sea-fight? Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? List to the story as my grandmother��s father, the sailor, told it to me. Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said he) His was the surly English pluck��and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be Along the lower��d eve he came, horribly raking us. We closed with him��the yards entangled��the cannon touch��d My captain lash��d fast with his own hands. We had receiv��d some eighteen pound shots under the water On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up overhead. Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark Ten o��clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold, to give them a chance for themselves. The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, They see so many strange faces, they do not know whom to trust. Our frigate takes fire The other asks if we demand quarter? If our colors are struck, and the fighting is done? Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain, We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting. Only three guns are in use One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy��s mainmast Two, well served with grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his decks. The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top They hold out bravely during the whole of the action. Not a moment��s cease The leaks gain fast on the pumps��the fire eats toward the powder-magazine. One of the pumps has been shot away��it is generally thought we are sinking. Serene stands the little captain He is not hurried��his voice is neither high nor low His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns. Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to us. Stretch��d and still lies the midnight Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking��preparations to pass to the one we have conquer��d The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet Near by, the corpse of the child that serv��d in the cabin The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl��d whiskers The flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft and below The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves��dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars, Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves, Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent, Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, The hiss of the surgeon��s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan These so��these irretrievable. O Christ! This is mastering me! In at the conquer��d doors they crowd. I am possess��d. I embody all presences outlaw��d or suffering See myself in prison shaped like another man, And feel the dull unintermitted pain. For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch It is I let out in the morning, and barr��d at night. Not a mutineer walks handcuff��d to jail, but I am handcuff��d to him and walk by his side (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one, with sweat on my twitching lips.) Not a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced. Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I also lie at the last gasp My face is ash-color��d��my sinews gnarl��away from me people retreat. Askers embody themselves in me, and I am embodied in them I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg. Enough! enough! enough! Somehow I have been stunn��d. Stand back! Give me a little time beyond my cuff��d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake. That I could forget the mockers and insults! That I could forget the trickling tears, and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers! That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning. I remember now I resume the overstaid fraction The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me. I troop forth replenish��d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession Inland and sea-coast we go, and we pass all boundary lines Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years. Eleves, I salute you! come forward! Continue your annotations, continue your questionings. The friendly and flowing savage, Who is he? Is he waiting for civilization, or past it, and mastering it? Is he some south-westerner, rais��d out-doors? Is he Kanadian? Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California? the mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or from the sea? Wherever he goes, men and women accept and desire him They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them. Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb��d head, laughter, and naivet��, Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath��they fly out of the glance of his eyes. Flaunt of the sunshine, I need not your bask,��lie over! You light surfaces only��I force surfaces and depths also. Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands Say, old Top-knot! what do you want? Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but cannot And might tell what it is in me, and what it is in you, but cannot And might tell that pining I have��that pulse of my nights and days. Behold! I do not give lectures, or a little charity When I give, I give myself. You there, impotent, loose in the knees! Open your scarf��d chops till I blow grit within you Spread your palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets I am not to be denied��I compel��I have stores plenty and to spare And anything I have I bestow. I do not ask who you are��that is not so important to me You can do nothing, and be nothing, but what I will infold you. To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean On his right cheek I put the family kiss, And in my soul I swear, I never will deny him. On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.) To any one dying��thither I speed, and twist the knob of the door Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed Let the physician and the priest go home. I seize the descending man, and raise him with resistless will. O despairer, here is my neck By God! you shall not go down! Hang your whole weight upon me. I dilate you with tremendous breath��I buoy you up Every room of the house do I fill with an arm��d force, Lovers of me, bafflers of graves. Sleep! I and they keep guard all night Not doubt��not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so. I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help. I heard what was said of the universe Heard it and heard it of several thousand years: It is middling well as far as it goes,��But is that all? Magnifying and applying come I, Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah, Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha, In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved, With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and image Taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days (They bore mites, as for unfledg��d birds, who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves) Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself�� bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see Discovering as much, or more, in a framer framing a house Putting higher claims for him there with his roll��d-up sleeves, driving the mallet and chisel Not objecting to special revelations��considering a curl of smoke, or a hair on the back of my hand, just as curious as any revelation Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the Gods of the antique wars Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction, Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr��d laths��their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames: By the mechanic��s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg��d out at their waists The snag-tooth��d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come, Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother, and sit by him while he is tried for forgery What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then The bull and the bug never worship��d half enough Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream��d The supernatural of no account��myself waiting my time to be one of the Supremes The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious: By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator Putting myself here and now to the ambush��d womb of the shadows. A call in the midst of the crowd My own voice, orotund, sweeping, and final. Come my children Come my boys and girls, my women, household, and intimates Now the performer launches his nerve��he has pass��d his prelude on the reeds within. Easily written, loose-finger��d chords! I feel the thrum of your climax and close. My head slues round on my neck Music rolls, but not from the organ Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine. Ever the hard, unsunk ground Ever the eaters and drinkers��ever the upward and downward sun��ever the air and the ceaseless tides Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real Ever the old inexplicable query��ever that thorn��d thumb��that breath of itches and thirsts Ever the vexer��s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides, and bring him forth Ever love��ever the sobbing liquid of life Ever the bandage under the chin��ever the tressels of death. Here and there, with dimes on the eyes, walking To feed the greed of the belly, the brains liberally spooning Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming. This is the city, and I am one of the citizens Whatever interests the rest interests me��politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools, Benevolent societies, improvements, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate, and personal estate. The little plentiful mannikins, skipping around in collars and tail��d coats, I am aware who they are��(they are positively not worms or fleas.) I acknowledge the duplicates of myself��the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me What I do and say, the same waits for them Every thought that flounders in me, the same flounders in them. I know perfectly well my own egotism I know my omnivorous lines, and will not write any less And would fetch you, whoever you are, flush with myself. No words of routine are mine, But abruptly to question, to leap beyond, yet nearer bring: This printed and bound book��but the printer, and the printing-office boy? The well-taken photographs��but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms? The black ship, mail��d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets��but the pluck of the captain and engineers? In the houses, the dishes and fare and furniture��but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes? The sky up there��yet here, or next door, or across the way? The saints and sages in history��but you yourself? Sermons, creeds, theology��but the fathomless human brain, And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life? I do not despise you, priests My faith is the greatest of faiths, and the least of faiths, Enclosing worship ancient and modern, and all between ancient and modern, Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years, Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the Gods, saluting the sun, Making a fetish of the first rock or stump, powwowing with sticks in the circle of obis, Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession��rapt and austere in the woods, a gymnosophist, Drinking mead from the skull-cup��to Shastas and Vedas admirant��minding the Koran, Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, Accepting the Gospels��accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, To the mass kneeling, or the puritan��s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew, Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me, Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land, Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits. One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang, I turn and talk, like a man leaving charges before a journey. Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded, Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten��d, atheistical I know every one of you��I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief. How the flukes splash! How they contort, rapid as lightning, with spasms, and spouts of blood! Be at peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers I take my place among you as much as among any The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same, And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same. I do not know what is untried and afterward But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail. Each who passes is consider��d��each who stops is consider��d��not a single one can it fail. It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried, Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side, Nor the little child that peep��d in at the door, and then drew back, and was never seen again, Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, Nor him in the poor house, tubercled by rum and the bad disorder, Nor the numberless slaughter��d and wreck��d��nor the brutish koboo call��d the ordure of humanity, Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in, Nor anything in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth, Nor anything in the myriads of spheres��nor one of the myriads of myriads that inhabit them, Nor the present��nor the least wisp that is known. It is time to explain myself��Let us stand up. What is known I strip away I launch all men and women forward with me into THE UNKNOWN. The clock indicates the moment��but what does eternity indicate? We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them. Births have brought us richness and variety, And other births will bring us richness and variety. I do not call one greater and one smaller That which fills its period and place is equal to any. Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister? I am sorry for you��they are not murderous or jealous upon me All has been gentle with me��I keep no account with lamentation (What have I to do with lamentation?) I am an acme of things accomplish��d, and I an encloser of things to be. My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps All below duly travel��d, and still I mount and mount. Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me Afar down I see the huge first Nothing��I know I was even there I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist, And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon. Long I was hugg��d close��long and long. Immense have been the preparations for me, Faithful and friendly the arms that have help��d me. Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings They sent influences to look after what was to hold me. Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me My embryo has never been torpid��nothing could overlay it. For it the nebula cohered to an orb, The long slow strata piled to rest it on, Vast vegetables gave it sustenance, Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and deposited it with care. All forces have been steadily employ��d to complete and delight me Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul. O span of youth! Ever-push��d elasticity! O manhood, balanced, florid, and full. My lovers suffocate me! Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, Jostling me through streets and public halls��coming naked to me at night, Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river��swinging and chirping over my head, Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, Lighting on every moment of my life, Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts, and giving them to be mine. Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days! Every condition promulges not only itself��it promulges what grows after and out of itself, And the dark hush promulges as much as any. I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge but the rim of the farther systems. Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding, Outward and outward, and forever outward. My sun has his sun, and round him obediently wheels, He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit, And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them. There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run We should surely bring up again where we now stand, And as surely go as much farther��and then farther and farther. A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or make it impatient They are but parts��anything is but a part. See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that. My rendezvous is appointed��it is certain The Lord will be there, and wait till I come, on perfect terms (The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine, will be there.) I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured, and never will be measured. I tramp a perpetual journey��(come listen all!) My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair I have no chair, no church, no philosophy I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, or exchange But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll, My left hand hooking you round the waist, My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents, and a plain public road. Not I��not any one else, can travel that road for you, You must travel it for yourself. It is not far��it is within reach Perhaps you have been on it since you were born, and did not know Perhaps it is every where on water and on land. Shoulder your duds, dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth, Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go. If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip, And in due time you shall repay the same service to me For after we start, we never lie by again. This day before dawn I ascended a hill, and look��d at the crowded heaven, And I said to my Spirit, When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, shall we be fill��d and satisfied then? And my Spirit said, No, we but level that life, to pass and continue beyond. You are also asking me questions, and I hear you I answer that I cannot answer��you must find out for yourself. Sit a while, dear son Here are biscuits to eat, and here is milk to drink But as soon as you sleep, and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-bye kiss, and open the gate for your egress hence. Long enough have you dream��d contemptible dreams Now I wash the gum from your eyes You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light, and of every moment of your life. Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore Now I will you to be a bold swimmer, To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair. I am the teacher of athletes He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own, proves the width of my own He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher. The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not through derived power, but in his own right, Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear, Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak, Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts, First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull��s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song, or play on the banjo, Preferring scars, and the beard, and faces pitted with small-pox, over all latherers, And those well tann��d to those that keep out of the sun. I teach straying from me��yet who can stray from me? I follow you, whoever you are, from the present hour My words itch at your ears till you understand them. I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat It is you talking just as much as myself��I act as the tongue of you Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen��d. I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house, And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air. If you would understand me, go to the heights or water-shore The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words. No shutter��d room or school can commune with me, But roughs and little children better than they. The young mechanic is closest to me��he knows me well The woodman, that takes his axe and jug with him, shall take me with him all day The farm-boy, ploughing in the field, feels good at the sound of my voice In vessels that sail, my words sail��I go with fishermen and seamen, and love them. The soldier camp��d, or upon the march, is mine On the night ere the pending battle, many seek me, and I do not fail them On the solemn night (it may be their last,) those that know me, seek me. My face rubs to the hunter��s face, when he lies down alone in his blanket The driver, thinking of me, does not mind the jolt of his wagon The young mother and old mother comprehend me The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment, and forget where they are They and all would resume what I have told them. I have said that the soul is not more than the body, And I have said that the body is not more than the soul And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one��s self is, And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, walks to his own funeral, drest in his shroud, And I or you, pocketless of a dime, may purchase the pick of the earth, And to glance with an eye, or show a bean in its pod, confounds the learning of all times, And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero, And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel��d universe, And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes. And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about God (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God, and about death.) I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least, Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself. Why should I wish to see God better than this day? I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass I find letters from God dropt in the street��and every one is sign��d by God��s name, And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe��er I go, Others will punctually come forever and ever. And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me. To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes I see the elder-hand, pressing, receiving, supporting I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape. And as to you, Corpse, I think you are good manure��but that does not offend me I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, I reach to the leafy lips��I reach to the polish��d breasts of melons. And as to you Life, I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.) I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven O suns! O grass of graves! O perpetual transfers and promotions! If you do not say anything, how can I say anything? Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! toss on the black stems that decay in the muck! Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs. I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small. There is that in me��I do not know what it is��but I know it is in me. Wrench��d and sweaty��calm and cool then my body becomes I sleep��I sleep long. I do not know it��it is without name��it is a word unsaid It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol. Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me. Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters. Do you see, O my brothers and sisters? It is not chaos or death��it is form, union, plan��it is eternal life��it is HAPPINESS. The past and present wilt��I have fill��d them, emptied them, And proceed to fill my next fold of the future. Listener up there! Here, you! What have you to confide to me? Look in my face, while I snuff the sidle of evening Talk honestly��no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer. Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself (I am large��I contain multitudes.) I concentrate toward them that are nigh��I wait on the door-slab. Who has done his day��s work? Who will soonest be through with his supper? Who wishes to walk with me? Will you speak before I am gone? Will you prove already too late? The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me��he complains of my gab and my loitering. I too am not a bit tamed��I too am untranslatable I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. The last scud of day holds back for me It flings my likeness after the rest, and true as any, on the shadow��d wilds It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk. I depart as air��I shake my white locks at the runaway sun I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags. I bequeathe myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles. You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood. Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged Missing me one place, search another I stop somewhere, waiting for you.\""

Illustrious the pale reflection on the new moon in the western sky! Illustrious whatever I see, or hear, or touch, to the last. Good in all, In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals, In the annual return of the seasons, In the hilarity of youth, In the strength and flush of manhood, In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age, In the superb vistas of Death. Wonderful to depart Wonderful to be here! The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood! To breathe the air, how delicious! To speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand! To prepare for sleep, for bed��to look on my rose-color��d flesh To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large To be this incredible God I am To have gone forth among other Gods��these men and women I love. Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself! How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around! How the clouds pass silently overhead! How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and on! How the water sports and sings! (Surely it is alive!) How the trees rise and stand up��with strong trunks��with branches and leaves! (Surely there is something more in each of the tree��some living Soul.) O amazement of things! even the least particle! O spirituality of things! O strain musical, flowing through ages and continents��now reaching me and America! I take your strong chords��I intersperse them, and cheerfully pass them forward. I too carol the sun, usher��d, or at noon, or, as now, setting, I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and of all the growths of the earth, I too have felt the resistless call of myself. As I sail��d down the Mississippi, As I wander��d over the prairies, As I have lived��As I have look��d through my windows, my eyes, As I went forth in the morning��As I beheld the light breaking in the east As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach of the Western Sea As I roam��d the streets of inland Chicago��whatever streets I have roam��d Or cities, or silent woods, or peace, or even amid the sights of war Wherever I have been, I have charged myself with contentment and triumph. I sing the Equalities, modern or old, I sing the endless finales of things I say Nature continues��Glory continues I praise with electric voice For I do not see one imperfection in the universe And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe. O setting sun! though the time has come, I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated adoration.\""

Noiseless as mists and vapors, From their graves in the trenches ascending, From the cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee, From every point of the compass, out of the countless unnamed graves, In wafted clouds, in myraids large, or squads of twos or threes, or single ones, they come, And silently gather round me. Now sound no note, O trumpeters! Not at the head of my cavalry, parading on spirited horses, With sabres drawn and glist��ning, and carbines by their thighs��(ah, my brave horsemen! My handsome, tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride, With all the perils, were yours!) Nor you drummers��neither at reveille, at dawn, Nor the long roll alarming the camp��nor even the muffled beat for a burial Nothing from you, this time, O drummers, bearing my warlike drums. But aside from these, and the marts of wealth, and the crowded promenade, Admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless, The slain elate and alive again��the dust and debris alive, I chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers. Faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet Draw close, but speak not. Phantoms of countless lost! Invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions! Follow me ever! desert me not, while I live. Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical voices sounding! But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes. Dearest comrades! all is over and long gone But love is not over��and what love, O comrades! Perfume from battle-fields rising��up from foetor arising. Perfume therefore my chant, O love! immortal Love! Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers, Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride! Perfume all! make all wholesome! Make these ashes to nourish and blossom, O love! O chant! solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry. Give me exhaustless��make me a fountain, That I exhale love from me wherever I go, like a moist perennial dew, For the ashes of all dead soldiers.\""

O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west, And thought of him I love. O powerful, western, fallen star! O shades of night! O moody, tearful night! O great star disappear��d! O the black murk that hides the star! O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul of me! O harsh surrounding cloud, that will not free my soul! In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house, near the white-wash��d palings, Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, With many a pointed blossom, rising, delicate, with the perfume strong I love, With every leaf a miracle......and from this bush in the door-yard, With delicate-color��d blossoms, and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, A sprig, with its flower, I break. In the swamp, in secluded recesses, A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. Solitary, the thrush, The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, Sings by himself a song. Song of the bleeding throat! Death��s outlet song of life��(for well, dear brother, I know If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would��st surely die.) Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, Amid lanes, and through old woods, (where lately the violets peep��d from the ground, spotting the gray debris) Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes��passing the endless grass Passing the yellow-spear��d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprising Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, Night and day journeys a coffin. Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land, With the pomp of the inloop��d flags, with the cities draped in black, With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil��d women, standing, With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night, With the countless torches lit��with the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour��d around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs��Where amid these you journey, With the tolling, tolling bells�� perpetual clang Here! coffin that slowly passes, I give you my sprig of lilac. (Nor for you, for one, alone Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring: For fresh as the morning��thus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death. All over bouquets of roses, O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.) O western orb, sailing the heaven! Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walk��d, As we walk��d up and down in the dark blue so mystic, As we walk��d in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night, As you droop��d from the sky low down, as if to my side, (while the other stars all look��d on) As we wander��d together the solemn night, (for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep) As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how full you were of woe As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold transparent night, As I watch��d where you pass��d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. Sing on, there in the swamp! O singer bashful and tender! I hear your notes��I hear your call I hear��I come presently��I understand you But a moment I linger��for the lustrous star has detain��d me The star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me. O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love? Sea-winds, blown from east and west, Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting: These, and with these, and the breath of my chant, I perfume the grave of him I love. O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial-house of him I love? Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes, With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. Lo! body and soul! this land! Mighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships The varied and ample land��the South and the North in the light��Ohio��s shores, and flashing Missouri, And ever the far-spreading prairies, cover��d with grass and corn. Lo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty The violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes The gentle, soft-born, measureless light The miracle, spreading, bathing all��the fulfill��d noon The coming eve, delicious��the welcome night, and the stars, Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. Sing on! sing on, you gray-brown bird! Sing from the swamps, the recesses��pour your chant from the bushes Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. Sing on, dearest brother��warble your reedy song Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. O liquid, and free, and tender! O wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous singer! You only I hear......yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart) Yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me. Now while I sat in the day, and look��d forth, In the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the farmer preparing his crops, In the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests, In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb��d winds, and the storms) Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides,��and I saw the ships how they sail��d, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages And the streets, how their throbbings throbb��d, and the cities pent��lo! then and there, Falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appear��d the cloud, appear��d the long black trail And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not, Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still. And the singer so shy to the rest receiv��d me The gray-brown bird I know, receiv��d us comrades three And he sang what seem��d the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. From deep secluded recesses, From the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird. And the charm of the carol rapt me, As I held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. DEATH CAROL. Come, lovely and soothing Death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later, delicate Death. Prais��d be the fathomless universe, For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious And for love, sweet love��But praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death. Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet, Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? Then I chant it for thee��I glorify thee above all I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. Approach, strong Deliveress! When it is so��when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death. From me to thee glad serenades, Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee��adornments and feastings for thee And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting, And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. The night, in silence, under many a star The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil��d Death, And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. Over the tree-tops I float thee a song! Over the rising and sinking waves��over the myriad fields, and the prairies wide Over the dense-pack��d cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death! To the tally of my soul, Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, With pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night. Loud in the pines and cedars dim, Clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume And I with my comrades there in the night. While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions. I saw askant the armies And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierc��d with missiles, I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) And the staffs all splinter��d and broken. I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, And the white skeletons of young men��I saw them I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war But I saw they were not as was thought They themselves were fully at rest��they suffer��d not The living remain��d and suffer��d��the mother suffer��d, And the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffer��d, And the armies that remain��d suffer��d. Passing the visions, passing the night Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades�� hands Passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul, (Victorious song, death��s outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,) Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring, I cease from my song for thee From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night. Yet each I keep, and all, retrievements out of the night The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arous��d in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe, With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep��for the dead I loved so well For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear sake Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.\""

The plenteousness of all��that there are no bounds To emerge, and be of the sky��of the sun and moon, and the flying clouds, as one with them. O the joy of a manly self-hood! Personality��to be servile to none��to defer to none��not to any tyrant, known or unknown, To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic, To look with calm gaze, or with a flashing eye, To speak with a full and sonorous voice, out of a broad chest, To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth. Know��st thou the excellent joys of youth? Joys of the dear companions, and of the merry word, and laughing face? Joys of the glad, light-beaming day��joy of the wide-breath��d games? Joy of sweet music��joy of the lighted ball-room, and the dancers? Joy of the friendly, plenteous dinner��the strong carouse, and drinking? Yet, O my soul supreme! Know��st thou the joys of pensive thought? Joys of the free and lonesome heart��the tender, gloomy heart? Joy of the solitary walk��the spirit bowed yet proud��the suffering and the struggle? The agonistic throes, the extasies��joys of the solemn musings, day or night? Joys of the thought of Death��the great spheres Time and Space? Prophetic joys of better, loftier love��s ideals��the Divine Wife��the sweet, eternal, perfect Comrade? Joys all thine own, undying one��joys worthy thee, O Soul. O, while I live, to be the ruler of life��not a slave, To meet life as a powerful conqueror, No fumes��no ennui��no more complaints, or scornful criticisms. O me repellent and ugly! To these proud laws of the air, the water, and the ground, proving my interior Soul impregnable, And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me. O to attract by more than attraction! How it is I know not��yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest, It is offensive, never defensive��yet how magnetic it draws. O joy of suffering! To struggle against great odds! to meet enemies undaunted! To be entirely alone with them! to find how much one can stand! To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face! To mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! To be indeed a God! O, to sail to sea in a ship! To leave this steady, unendurable land! To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the houses To leave you, O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship, To sail, and sail, and sail! O to have my life henceforth a poem of new joys! To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on, To be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports, A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,) A swift and swelling ship, full of rich words��full of joys.\""

    "text": "\"OUT of the cradle endlessly rocking, Out of the mocking-bird��s throat, the musical shuttle, Out of the Ninth-month midnight, Over the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child, leaving his bed, wander��d alone, bare-headed, barefoot, Down from the shower��d halo, Up from the mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting as if they were alive, Out from the patches of briers and blackberries, From the memories of the bird that chanted to me, From your memories, sad brother��from the fitful risings and fallings I heard, From under that yellow half-moon, late-risen, and swollen as if with tears, From those beginning notes of sickness and love, there in the transparent mist, From the thousand responses of my heart, never to cease, From the myriad thence-arous��d words, From the word stronger and more delicious than any, From such, as now they start, the scene revisiting, As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing, Borne hither��ere all eludes me, hurriedly, A man��yet by these tears a little boy again, Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves, I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter, Taking all hints to use them��but swiftly leaping beyond them, A reminiscence sing. Once, Paumanok, When the snows had melted��when the lilac-scent was in the air, and the Fifth-month grass was growing, Up this sea-shore, in some briers, Two guests from Alabama��two together, And their nest, and four light-green eggs, spotted with brown, And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand, And every day the she-bird, crouch��d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes, And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them, Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating. Shine! shine! shine! Pour down your warmth, great Sun! While we bask��we two together. Two together! Winds blow South, or winds blow North, Day come white, or night come black, Home, or rivers and mountains from home, Singing all time, minding no time, While we two keep together. Till of a sudden, May-be kill��d, unknown to her mate, One forenoon the she-bird crouch��d not on the nest, Nor return��d that afternoon, nor the next, Nor ever appear��d again. And thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea, And at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather, Over the hoarse surging of the sea, Or flitting from brier to brier by day, I saw, I heard at intervals, the remaining one, the he-bird, The solitary guest from Alabama. Blow! blow! blow! Blow up, sea-winds, along Paumanok��s shore! I wait and I wait, till you blow my mate to me. Yes, when the stars glisten��d, All night long, on the prong of a moss-scallop��d stake, Down, almost amid the slapping waves, Sat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears. He call��d on his mate He pour��d forth the meanings which I, of all men, know. Yes, my brother, I know The rest might not��but I have treasur��d every note For once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding, Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows, Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts, The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing, I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair, Listen��d long and long. Listen��d, to keep, to sing��now translating the notes, Following you, my brother. Soothe! soothe! soothe! Close on its wave soothes the wave behind, And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close, But my love soothes not me, not me. Low hangs the moon��it rose late O it is lagging��O I think it is heavy with love, with love. O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land, With love��with love. O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among the breakers? What is that little black thing I see there in the white? Loud! loud! loud! Loud I call to you, my love! High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves Surely you must know who is here, is here You must know who I am, my love. Low-hanging moon! What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow? O it is the shape, the shape of my mate! O moon, do not keep her from me any longer. Land! land! O land! Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look. O rising stars! Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you. O throat! O trembling throat! Sound clearer through the atmosphere! Pierce the woods, the earth Somewhere listening to catch you, must be the one I want. Shake out, carols! Solitary here��the night��s carols! Carols of lonesome love! Death��s carols! Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon! O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea! O reckless, despairing carols. But soft! sink low Soft! let me just murmur And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me, So faint��I must be still, be still to listen But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me. Hither, my love! Here I am! Here! With this just-sustain��d note I announce myself to you This gentle call is for you, my love, for you. Do not be decoy��d elsewhere! That is the whistle of the wind��it is not my voice That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray Those are the shadows of leaves. O darkness! O in vain! O I am very sick and sorrowful. O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea! O troubled reflection in the sea! O throat! O throbbing heart! O all��and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night. Yet I murmur, murmur on! O murmurs��you yourselves make me continue to sing, I know not why. O past! O life! O songs of joy! In the air��in the woods��over fields Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved! But my love no more, no more with me! We two together no more. The aria sinking All else continuing��the stars shining, The winds blowing��the notes of the bird continuous echoing, With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning, On the sands of Paumanok��s shore, gray and rustling The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching The boy extatic��with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying, The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting, The aria��s meaning, the ears, the Soul, swiftly depositing, The strange tears down the cheeks coursing, The colloquy there��the trio��each uttering, The undertone��the savage old mother, incessantly crying, To the boy��s Soul��s questions sullenly timing��some drown��d secret hissing, To the outsetting bard of love. Demon or bird! (said the boy��s soul,) Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me? For I, that was a child, my tongue��s use sleeping, Now I have heard you, Now in a moment I know what I am for��I awake, And already a thousand singers��a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours, A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, Never to die. O you singer, solitary, singing by yourself��projecting me O solitary me, listening��nevermore shall I cease perpetuating you Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations, Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me, Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there, in the night, By the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon, The messenger there arous��d��the fire, the sweet hell within, The unknown want, the destiny of me. O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere) O if I am to have so much, let me have more! O a word! O what is my destination? (I fear it is henceforth chaos) O how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes, and all shapes, spring as from graves around me! O phantoms! you cover all the land and all the sea! O I cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me O vapor, a look, a word! O well-beloved! O you dear women��s and men��s phantoms! A word then, (for I will conquer it,) The word final, superior to all, Subtle, sent up��what is it?��I listen Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves? Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands? Whereto answering, the sea, Delaying not, hurrying not, Whisper��d me through the night, and very plainly before day-break, Lisp��d to me the low and delicious word DEATH And again Death��ever Death, Death, Death, Hissing melodious, neither like the bird, nor like my arous��d child��s heart, But edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet, Creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over, Death, Death, Death, Death, Death. Which I do not forget, But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother, That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok��s gray beach, With the thousand responsive songs, at random, My own songs, awaked from that hour And with them the key, the word up from the waves, The word of the sweetest song, and all songs, That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet, The sea whisper��d me.\""

    "text": "\"I SING the Body electric The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul. Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? And if the body does not do as much as the Soul? And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul? The love of the Body of man or woman balks account��the body itself balks account That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. The expression of the face balks account But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees��dress does not hide him The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats��the horseman in his saddle, Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, The female soothing a child��the farmer��s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, The young fellow hoeing corn��the sleigh-driver guiding his six horses through the crowd, The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work, The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, The upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, The natural, perfect, varied attitudes��the bent head, the curv��d neck, and the counting Such-like I love��I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother��s breast with the little child, Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, and count. I know a man, a common farmer��the father of five sons And in them were the fathers of sons��and in them were the fathers of sons. This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes��the richness and breadth of his manners, These I used to go and visit him to see��he was wise also He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old��his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome They and his daughters loved him��all who saw him loved him They did not love him by allowance��they loved him with personal love He drank water only��the blood show��d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face He was a frequent gunner and fisher��he sail��d his boat himself��he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner��he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang. You would wish long and long to be with him��you would wish to sit by him in the boat, that you and he might touch each other. I have perceiv��d that to be with those I like is enough, To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment��what is this, then? I do not ask any more delight��I swim in it, as in a sea. There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well All things please the soul��but these please the soul well. This is the female form A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction! I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor��all falls aside but myself and it Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds, and what was expected of heaven or fear��d of hell, are now consumed Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it��the response likewise ungovernable Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused��mine too diffused Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb��love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn Undulating into the willing and yielding day, Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh��d day. This is the nucleus��after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman This is the bath of birth��this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. Be not ashamed, women��your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. The female contains all qualities, and tempers them��she is in her place, and moves with perfect balance She is all things duly veil��d��she is both passive and active She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. As I see my soul reflected in nature As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty, See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast��the female I see. The male is not less the soul, nor more��he too is in his place He too is all qualities��he is action and power The flush of the known universe is in him Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him well��pride is for him The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul Knowledge becomes him��he likes it always��he brings everything to the test of himself Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only here (Where else does he strike soundings, except here?) The man��s body is sacred, and the woman��s body is sacred No matter who it is, it is sacred Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off��just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession. (All is a procession The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.) Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-face ignorant? Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float��and the soil is on the surface, and water runs, and vegetation sprouts, For you only, and not for him and her? A man��s Body at auction I help the auctioneer��the sloven does not half know his business. Gentlemen, look on this wonder! Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one animal or plant For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll��d. In this head the all-baffling brain In it and below it, the makings of heroes. Examine these limbs, red, black, or white��they are so cunning in tendon and nerve They shall be stript, that you may see them. Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, And wonders within there yet. Within there runs blood, The same old blood! The same red-running blood! There swells and jets a heart��there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations Do you think they are not there because they are not express��d in parlors and lecture-rooms? This is not only one man��this is the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns In him the start of populous states and rich republics Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and enjoyments. How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries? A woman��s Body at auction! She too is not only herself��she is the teeming mother of mothers She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. Have you ever loved the Body of a woman? Have you ever loved the Body of a man? Your father��where is your father? Your mother��is she living? have you been much with her? and has she been much with you? ��Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all over the earth? If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred, And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful as the most beautiful face. Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the Soul, (and that they are the Soul) I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems��and that they are poems, Man��s, woman��s, child��s, youth��s, wife��s, husband��s, mother��s, father��s, young man��s, young woman��s poems Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest. Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-balls, finger-joints, finger-nails, Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone, Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg, Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body, or of any one��s body, male or female, The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, Womanhood, and all that is a woman��and the man that comes from woman, The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair, The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out, The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, The thin red jellies within you, or within me��the bones, and the marrow in the bones, The exquisite realization of health O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul, O I say now these are the Soul!\""
