    "text": "As I sit under the lamp, writing out my daily page, I hear a faint noise. If I stop, it stops too. It begins again, as soon as I scratch my way across the paper.\nIt is a mouse waking up.\nI sense her comings and going around the dark corner where the maid keeps her rags and brushes.\nThe mouse jumps onto the floor and trots across the kitchen tiles. She passes near the fireplace, under the sink, vanishes into the dishes, and by a series of reconnaissance missions which she extends farther and farther, approaches me.\nEach time I set down my pen, the silence alarms her. Each time I use it, she thinks, I suppose, that there is another mouse somewhere, and this reassures her.\nThen I lose sight of her. She is under my table, at my feet. She circulates from one chair leg to the next. She brushes against my shoes, nibbles the sole, or, boldly, gets up on top!\nAnd now I must not move my leg, or breathe too hard: she would vanish.\nBut I have to go on writing, or else she would abandon me to my solitude—I write, I doodle, little things, tiny, dainty, the way she nibbles."

    "title": "Juan Bueno’s Losses",
    "text": "This is the story of a fellow called Juan Bueno—Johnny Goodfellow, you see. People called him that because from the time he was a boy, when someone would give him a smack on one side of the head, he would turn his cheek for another. His schoolmates would take away his candies and cakes, strip him almost naked in the street, and when he got home, his parents, one on one side, one on the other, would pinch him and slap him until his ears rang. And so he grew up, until he became a man. How this poor Juan suffered! He got smallpox, but he didn’t die, though his face was left looking as though a dozen hens had been pecking at it. He was sent to jail in the place of another Juan—Juan Lanas. And he suffered all this with such patience that all the townspeople, when they said There goes Juan Bueno! would laugh out loud.\nAnd then the day came when this fellow got married.\nOne morning St. Joseph, in excellent humor, with his halo of glory upon his head, a new cloak upon his back, bright new sandals upon his feet, and his long flowering staff to aid him, went out for a walk through the village in which Juan Bueno lived and suffered. Christmas night was near, and St. Joseph was thinking about his baby, Jesus, and the preparations for his birth; he strolled along blessing the good believers and from time to time softly humming some carol or another. As he was walking along one street he heard a great racket, and much moaning and lamenting, and he found—oh, grievous sight!—Juan Bueno’s wife, bam, bam, bam, giving her wretched spouse what-for.\nHalt! called out the putative father of the divine Savior. I’ll have no such rows in my presence!\nJust that short and sweet. The fierce Gorgon grew calmer, the couple made their peace, and when Juan told his tale of woe good St. Joseph consoled him, gave him a pat or two on the back, and as he bade him good night, he said to him:\nIt will all be all right, my son. Soon your troubles will be over. In the meantime, I’ll help you as much as I can. You know, with whatever comes along. You can find me in the parish church, the altar to the right. So long, now.\nHappy as could be, was good Juan Bueno at these tidings. And it may well be imagined that he went off, day after day, almost hour after hour, to visit the shoulder he knew he could cry on.—Lord, this has happened! Lord, this other! Lord, can you imagine what’s happened now! He asked for everything, and everything was granted. Well, not quite everything, because he was too embarrassed to tell the saint that his tyrant of a wife had not lost the habit of boxing his ears. So when St. Joseph would ask him, What’s that bump on your head there? he would laugh and change the subject. But St. Joseph knew very well . . . and he admired Juan’s forbearance.\nOne day Juan came in terribly sad and downcast.\nI’ve lost, he moaned, a bag of silver I’d put away. Could you find it for me?\nWell, that’s really St. Anthony’s job, but we’ll see what we can do.\nAnd indeed when Juan returned to his house, he found the little bag of silver.\nAnother day Juan came in with his face all swollen and one eye practically falling out of its socket.\nThe cow you gave me has disappeared!\nAnd the kind saint replied:\nGo home, you’ll find it.\nAnd another time:\nThe mule you were so kind as to give me has run off!\nAnd the saint replied:\nNow, now, off home with you, the mule will come back.\nAnd so on, for many months.\nUntil one day the saint was not in the cheeriest of moods, and Juan Bueno came in with his face looking like an overripe tomato and his head all squashed out of shape. When the good saint saw him, he went, Hm, hm.\nLord, I come to ask another favor of you. My wife has left me, and since you are so good . . .\nSt. Joseph’s patience with Juan Bueno had reached its limit. He lifted his flowering staff and smacked Juan Bueno on the very top of his head, at a spot exactly between his ears.\nTo hell with you—where you’ll find her for yourself, you blockhead!"

    "title": "Cyril Tourneur: Tragic Poet",
    "text": "Cyril Tourneur was born out of the union of an unknown god with a prostitute. Proof enough of his divine origin has been found in the heroic atheism to which he succumbed. From his mother he inherited the instinct for revolt and luxury, the fear of death, the thrill of passion and the hate of kings. His father bequeathed him his desire for a crown, his pride of power and his joy of creating. To him both parents handed down their taste for nocturnal things, for a red glare in the night, and for blood.\nThe exact date of his birth is not known, though we are told that he appeared one dark day during a pestilential year.\nNo celestial protector watched over the woman whose body was swollen with this infant god, for the plague touched her several days before her confinement, and the door of her little house was marked with a red cross. At the moment when Cyril Tourneur was coming into the world the sexton at the cemetery began to toll the bell for the burial of the dead. Then, quite as his father had disappeared into that heaven common to all gods, so a green cart dragged his mother away to the common grave of men.\nThat night is said to have been so dark that the sexton had to hold a torch by the pesthouse door while the grim carter gathered his load. Another historian tells us how the mists upon the river Thames (by Cyril Tourneur’s birthplace) were shot with scarlet rays while the sound of the bells was like the barking of cynocephales. There is little doubt but that a real star rose flaming over the house tops. The new born child shook his feeble fists as its fiery, malevolent gleams mottled his upturned face. So came Cyril Tourneur into the empty vastness of the Cimmerian night.\nIt is impossible to discover what were his thoughts or habits before he reached the age of thirty. The signs of his latent divinity had no record, nor do we know how he first recognized his hidden sovereignty. An obscure list of his blasphemies has come to light. From this document we know that he declared Moses nothing more than a juggler, while one named Heriot, he said, was an infinitely cleverer juggler than Moses. The beginning of religion, according to Cyril, consisted in terrorizing man. Christ, he held, merited death more than Barabbas, though Barabbas were thief and murderer. Should he, Cyril Tourneur, write a new religion, he said, he could vow to establish it upon a finer, more admirable basis. He thought the style of the New Testament wholly repugnant. He declared that his right to coin money was as good as the queen of England’s, and furthermore, that he knew a man named Poole, a prisoner at Newgate, with whose aid he meant some day to strike gold pieces in his own image. A pious soul has erased the more terrible affirmations from this document.\nCyril Tourneur’s words have been overheard and his gestures thought to indicate an atheism even more vindictive. He has been represented to us cloaked in a long black robe, a glorious twelve-starred crown on his head, his feet resting on the celestial sphere while he holds the terrestrial globe in his right hand. Pale as a wax taper on an altar, with eyes deeply aglow like burning incense, he walked the streets on stormy nights when the pest was over the city. Some have said he had a strange mark like a seal on his right thigh, but the point will never be verified since no one saw his body naked after death.\nFor mistress he took a prostitute from Bankside, a girl who had haunted the waterfront streets. He called her Rosamonde. His love for her was unique. On her blonde, innocent face the rouge spots burned like flickering flames, and she was very young. Rosamonde bore Cyril Tourneur a daughter whom he loved. Having been looked at by a prince, Rosamonde died tragically, drinking emerald-coloured poison from a transparent cup.\nVengeance merged with pride in Cyril’s soul. Night came . . . he walked the Mall, down the full length of that royal promenade, flourishing a torch of burning horsehair to illuminate his face, this poisoner prince. Hatred of all who reign was in his mouth and on his hands. So he became a highwayman, not to steal but to assassinate kings. Various princes who disappeared in those days were lighted to their death by Cyril Tourneur’s torch before he killed them.\nHe would lie in wait along the queen’s highway, hiding near some gravel pit or lime kiln. Selecting his victim from a group of travellers, he would offer to guide the gentleman through the quagmires. At the mouth of the pit he would extinguish his torch and hurl the unsuspecting man into the black hole. The gravel always gave way under their feet and Cyril would roll two enormous stones down to stifle the cries. In the dull glow of the kiln, he would sit through the night watching the cadaver as the lime consumed it.\nWhen Cyril Tourneur had thus satisfied his hatred for kings he was assailed by his hatred of the gods. The divine spark within him urged him on to original creation. He dreamed of founding an entire generation out of his own blood—a race of gods on earth. He looked at his daughter. She was pure and desirable. To carry out his plan under the eyes of heaven he chose a cemetery as the most appropriate scene. Vowing to brave death and create a new humanity in the heart of that destruction decreed by the gods, Cyril Tourneur sought among old, dead bones to engender new ones. He carried out this project on the roof of a charnelhouse.\nThe end of his life is lost in a haze of obscurity. We may not be sure what pen has given us The Athiest’s Tragedy and The Revenger’s Tragedy. One legend pretends that the pride of Cyril Tourneur went still farther. He is said to have raised a black throne in his garden. Several persons have seen him sitting there with his gold crown on his head, though they all ran away, frightened by the long blue aigrettes waving to and fro above him. He read the poems of Empedocles in the manuscript. He often expressed his admiration for the manner in which the ancient poet died. No one saw the manuscript of Empedocles after Cyril Tourneur disappeared. That year the plague was come again, and the people of London took refuge on barges floating midstream in the Thames. One night a meteor flashed across the face of the moon. Moving with a sinister roar it whirled like a globe of white fire toward Cyril Tourneur’s house. On his black throne, in his black robes and his golden crown, the man waited for the comet. Like a battle on the stage, an ominous blast of trumpets sounded a funereal fanfare across the night. In a shimmering, sanguine blaze, Cyril Tourneur was borne away to some unknown god in the somber, stormy regions of the sky."

    "title": "Last Visit to Mallarmé",
    "text": "I saw Stéphane Mallarmé for the last time on the 14th of July, 1898, at Valvins. When lunch was over, he took me into his study. Four paces long by two paces wide; the window opening onto the Seine and onto the forest through foliage rent apart by light, and the smallest movements of the shining river faintly reflected on the walls.\nMallarmé was worried about the finishing touches to the construction of the Coup de Dés. The inventor was contem-plating and touching up with a pencil this new machine which the Lahure Press had agreed to construct.\nNothing had so far been undertaken—or even considered—to give the form of the text a significance and an effect comparable to those of the text itself. Just as the everyday use of our limbs makes us almost forget their existence and neglect the variety of their resources, and just as it happens that an artist in the use of the human body sometimes points out to us all their suppleness, at the cost of his life which he consumes in exercises and which he exposes to the dangers of his addiction, so the habitual use of language, the practice of reading at random, and the use of everyday expressions, weaken the understanding of these too familiar acts and banish the very conception of their power and of their possible perfection, unless some person survives and dedicates himself who is particularly disdainful of the easy ways of the mind, but singularly attentive to what he can produce that is most unexpected and most subtle.\nI was in the presence of such a person. Nothing told me that I should never see him again. On this golden day there was no raven to foretell it.\nEverything was calm and certain. . . . But while Mallarmé was talking to me, with his finger on the page, I remember that my mind began to contemplate this particular moment. Absent-mindedly I gave it an almost absolute value. Near him while he was still alive, I thought of his destiny as already realized. Born for the delight of some and to the dismay of others, and to the amazement of all; for the latter a madness and an absurdity; for his own kind a marvel of pride, elegance and intellectual modesty, a few poems had sufficed for him to put in doubt the very purpose of literature. His work, difficult to understand and impossible to neglect, divided literate people. Poor and without honors, the nakedness of his condition disgraced all the advantages that others had; but he was assured, without having looked for it, of extraordinary loyalty. As for him, whose wise, disdainful victim’s smile quietly disposed of the universe, he had never asked anything of the world but the most precious and rarest things it contained. He found them in himself.\nWe went into the country. The ‘artificial’ poet gathered the simplest flowers. Our arms were filled with corn-flowers and poppies. The air was on fire; the splendor absolute; the silence full of intoxication and communication; death impossible or unimportant; everything amazingly beautiful, afire and asleep; and the landscape trembled.\nIn the sun, in the immense arc of the cloudless sky, I dreamed of an incandescent space where nothing distinct exists, where nothing lasts, but where nothing ends, as if destruction itself was destroyed before it was accomplished. I lost my perception of the difference between being and not-being. Sometimes music gives us this impression, which is beyond all others. Is not poetry, I thought, the supreme pastime of transmuting ideas?. . .\nMallarmé pointed out to me the plain which summer was already beginning to turn to gold; Look, he said, it is the first drum-beat of autumn on the earth.\nWhen autumn came, he was no more."

    "text": "A Sunday rain was falling, completely by mistake, since it was Tuesday, the dry day of the week par excellence. Even so, nothing was happening: the all-out-strike order of things was carried out without incident.\nWithout disturbing this embroiled state of affairs I pushed back my chair, making the noise with which a petty tyrant under-assistant-bureaucrat sets twenty underlings quaking in their boots and yawning. I took my rack from its hat and, putting both arms into the sleeves, wound the calendar, ripped that day’s leaf from the clock, put some coal in the icebox, added ice to the stove, supplemented the wall thermometer with all the thermometers I had handy just to ward off an approaching cold spell, and, as a streetcar ran catchably by, I sprang to the sidewalk and fell comfortably into my desk easy chair.\nHere was a matter for thought: the days were going by all at once and yet no light was shed on the mystery (no one knew that there was one) of the forthcoming bridge. First: we were shown a diagram of the bridge, showing how far construction had progressed, before anyone had even thought of bringing it into existence; second: a sketch of what the bridge was like when somebody was thinking of it; third: a photograph of someone crossing the bridge; fourth: construction is begun on the first span. In short: the bridge was already finished, but it had to be extended over to the opposite bank, since due to an oversight the bridge had been built to go from one bank to the same bank of the river.\nAnd why was it that the government official, whose carefully-considered speech was dedicated, with throat-clearing eloquence, to the bridge, since one or the other of them had a slight cold, I’m not sure which one, accuse it of ingratitude toward the government?\nYou don’t need to be reminded how humanity has suffered from the ingratitude of bridges. Yet, in this case, where did the ingratitude lie? Surely not over on the other side of the river, because the bridge didn’t lead to that side and, in truth, the great labor that lay at hand was to get the water to flow under the bridge. It was the least that could be demanded and expected of a river that had so far played no part in the bridge effort."

The skies have not formulated a thought that I can breathe into my being. In the whole valley of the Mississippi River there is no bed of thought in which I can lie.\nThere are farm women living in houses that stand beside dusty roads in Illinois and Iowa. In Indiana and Ohio there are many towns. In Michigan—far up where the valley is no more and where the cold finger of the north touches the earth in September—there are men living who wear heavy boots and fur caps and who walk all day under naked trees.\nEverywhere are men and women who arouse wonder in me. I have awakened the feeling of wonder in myself. I have awakened from sleeping under a tree."

The whole audience was armed and it turned out the hall was filled with nothing but . . . and . . . Then neighbors were murdered, jets of liquid fire. There was the siege of the boxes, the siege of the stage, the siege of a folding chair and the battle lasted eighteen days. Maybe the two camps were resupplied, I don’t know, but what I know for sure is the newsmen all came for the grim performance, that one of them, being sick, sent his dear mother and she was deeply impressed by the sang-froid of a young French gentleman who held out for eighteen days in a proscenium box on nothing more than a little bouillon. This episode of the War of the Balconies did a lot for voluntary enlistments in the provinces. And I know of three brothers in brand-new uniforms, on my river bank, under my trees, who embraced each other dry-eyed while their families searched for sweaters in attic armoires."

Up over the sand, and among these stones the water slides in tracery like May blossom or silver mail. A little way out, the long wave lifts itself up laboriously into a shadowy cliff, nods proudly and crumbles, vain and swift, into a thousand sparks of foam. Far out the desolate, ridgy leagues vibrate and murmur with an unintelligible voice, not less intelligible than when one man says, I believe, or another man, I love, or another, I am your friend. Almost at the horizon a sharp white sail sways, invisibly controlled. In a minute it does not move; in half an hour it has moved. It fascinates and becomes the image of the watcher’s hopes, as when in some tranquil grief we wait, with faint curiosity and sad foretelling, to see how our plans will travel, smiling a little even when they stray or stop, because we have foretold it. Will the sail sink? Will it take wing into the sky? Will it go straight and far, and overcome and celebrate its success? But it only fades away, and presently another is there unasked, yet not surprising, and it also fades away, and the night has come, and still the sea speaks with tongues. In the moonlight one strange flower glistens, white as a campanula, like a sweet-pea in shape—the bleached thigh-bone of a rat— and we forget the rest."

I know that your good firm is large, proud, old, and rich, thus I may yield to the pleasing supposition that a nice, easy, pretty little place would be available, into which, as into a kind of warm cubbyhole, I can slip. I am excellently suited, you should know, to occupy just such a modest haven, for my nature is altogether delicate, and I am essentially a quiet, polite, and dreamy child, who is made to feel cheerful by people thinking of him that he does not ask for much, and allowing him to take possession of a very, very small patch of existence, where he can be useful in his own way and thus feel at ease. A quiet, sweet, small place in the shade has always been the tender substance of all my dreams, and if now the illusions I have about you grow so intense as to make me hope that my dream, young and old, might be transformed into delicious, vivid reality, then you have, in me, the most zealous and most loyal servitor, who will take it as a matter of conscience to discharge precisely and punctually all his duties. Large and difficult tasks I cannot perform, and obligations of a far-ranging sort are too strenuous for my mind. I am not particularly clever, and first and foremost I do not like to strain my intelligence overmuch. I am a dreamer rather than a thinker, a zero rather than a force, dim rather than sharp. Assuredly there exists in your extensive institution, which I imagine to be overflowing with main and subsidiary functions and offices, work of the kind that one can do as in a dream?—I am, to put it frankly, a Chinese; that is to say, a person who deems everything small and modest to be beautiful and pleasing, and to whom all that is big and exacting is fearsome and horrid. I know only the need to feel at my ease, so that each day I can thank God for life’s boon, with all its blessings. The passion to go far in the world is unknown to me. Africa with its deserts is to me not more foreign. Well, so now you know what sort of a person I am.—I write, as you see, a graceful and fluent hand, and you need not imagine me to be entirely without intelligence. My mind is clear, but it refuses to grasp things that are many, or too many by far, shunning them. I am sincere and honest, and I am aware that this signifies precious little in the world in which we live, so I shall be waiting, esteemed gentlemen, to see what it will be your pleasure to reply to your respectful servant, positively drowning in obedience."

    "title": "Little Recipes from Modern Magic",
    "text": "The magician’s industry, which in our time is taking on the proportions of one of the most enjoyable arts—I’d almost say one of the most useful to high society—magic, had to undergo numerous transformations to get out of the ruts laid down by charlatanism and routine. The abuse seen in this last century, with table-turning, all kinds of mediums, hypnotism, cards, offhand palmistry, coffee grounds often harmful to the health, as in Turkey, for example, have given birth to troublesome and often exaggerated prejudices. The magician has been replaced by the fortune teller, if not by the clairvoyant.\nBut since the magician, refusing to compete with these absurd rivals, calls for surprising combinations from science and the fine arts, concerns himself above all with hygiene, studies the raw materials, arranges them in a rational manner, since finally magic has taken on new forms in perfect harmony with good taste and reason, these prejudices have greatly diminished. They will disappear completely when creations made for the theatre and costume parties are distinguished from those destined for good company. For the former, the recipes for fast results, but too violent to endure. For the salons, the simple and suave combinations, the serious methods, which, without appearing to do so, master destiny, and which, in short, confer power and talent.\nConsidered from this double point of view, the magician’s art merits the esteem and the interest of sensible people. I hope to show one proof of this in these recipes chosen for use by society people.\nIt’s very easy to make. You take several fillets of sole—new shoes are not necessary, old ones being fine for this use: in fact the sole should be aged well. Take every precaution that the sole not take on your odor as you clean it—to do so, dredge your hands in flour beforehand. Cut the sole into pieces and put them in a basket in the oven. When they have lost all their moisture, grind them up in a mortar and pass the dust through a very fine sieve. Finally, mix it with a solution of horse fat. You’ll be delighted with it.\nIt sometimes happens that such-and-such a young man— nearly a child—becomes highly successful in the salons with his metrics or with others’ metrics, and one would wish to do the same.\nGo to work for the gas company and you’ll learn all about meters; if the recipe doesn’t succeed, go to a gymnasium and learn about isometrics; and if that fails, study the metric system.\nAnother recipe for poetry\nYou should always carry an umbrella you never open. Revealed by M. André B., this recipe is supposed to have been entrusted to him by our dear M. P.F., prince of poets.\nTake three pounds of freshly picked ice leaves. Peel them and spread them to dry somewhat; do not forget to stir from time to time so they won’t warm up. Next let them marinate in twelve quarts of good Orléans vinegar. Then distill in a double boiler, over a medium heat at the start. You will easily obtain eight quarts from this operation and pennies will rain down in abundance.\nShake well before using, then wash your feet thoroughly with it.\nIt should be added that trustworthy people, among whom M. René Dalize, have used some of these recipes and have acknowledged their complete effectiveness."

In the meantime, however, four long, lean and strong hands oversee the process as carefully as nurses to make sure that each hook gets a worm.\nThe men who do this crouch two by two on knees and heels, with mighty, bony backs, long, kindly faces, and pipes in their mouths. They exchange incomprehensible words that flow forth as softly as the motion of their hands. One of them takes up a fat earthworm with two fingers, tears it into three pieces with the same two fingers of the other hand, as easily and exactly as a shoemaker snips off the paper band after he’s taken the measurement; the other one then presses these squirming pieces calmly and carefully onto each hook. This having been accomplished, the worms are then doused with water and laid in neat little beds, one next to the other, in the drawer with the soft sand, where they can die without immediately losing their freshness.\nIt is a quiet, delicate activity, whereby the coarse fishermen’s fingers step softly as on tiptoes. You have to pay close attention. In fair weather the dark blue sky arches above and the seagulls circle high over the land like white swallows."

    "text": "Whatever hour you woke there was a door shutting. From room to room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure—a ghostly couple.\nHere we left it, she said. And he added, Oh, but here too! It’s upstairs, she murmured. And in the garden, he whispered. Quietly, they said, or we shall wake them.\nBut it wasn’t that you woke us. Oh, no. They’re looking for it; they’re drawing the curtain, one might say, and so read on a page or two. Now they’ve found it, one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm. What did I come in here for? What did I want to find? My hands were empty. Perhaps its upstairs then? The apples were in the loft. And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass.\nBut they had found it in the drawing-room. Not that one could ever see them. The windowpanes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing-room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling—what? My hands were empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat softly. The treasure buried; the room . . . the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the buried treasure?\nA moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burnt behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us; coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs. Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat gladly. The Treasure yours.\nThe wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff and still. Wandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy.\nHere we slept, she says. And he adds, Kisses without number. Waking in the morning— Silver between the trees— Upstairs— ‘In the garden— When summer came— ‘In winter snowtime— The doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the pulse of a heart.\nNearer they come; cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain slides silver down the glass. Our eyes darken; we hear no steps beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands shield the lantern. Look, he breathes. Sound asleep. Love upon their lips.\nStooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.\nSafe, safe, safe, the heart of the house beats proudly. Long years— he sighs. Again you found me. Here, she murmurs, sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our treasure— Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. Safe! safe! safe! the pulse of the house beats wildly. Waking, I cry Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in the heart."

    "title": "Poseidon",
    "text": "Poseidon sat at his desk, going over the accounts. The administration of all the waters gave him endless work. He could have had as many assistants as he wanted, and indeed he had quite a number, but since he took his job very seriously he insisted on going through all the accounts again himself, and so his assistants were of little help to him. It cannot be said that he enjoyed the work; he carried it out simply because it was assigned to him; indeed he had frequently applied for what he called more cheerful work, but whenever various suggestions were put to him it turned out that nothing suited him so well as his present employment. Needless to say, it was very difficult to find him another job. After all, he could not possibly be put in charge of one particular ocean. Quite apart from the fact that in this case the work involved would not be less, only more petty, the great Poseidon could hold only a superior position. And when he was offered a post unrelated to the waters, the very idea made him feel sick, his divine breath came short and his brazen chest began to heave. As a matter of fact, no one took his troubles very seriously; when a mighty man complains one must pretend to yield, however hopeless the case may seem. No one ever really considered relieving Poseidon of his position; he had been destined to be God of the Seas since time immemorial, and that was how it had to remain.\nWhat annoyed him most—and this was the chief cause of discontent with his job—was to learn of the rumors that were circulating about him; for instance, that he was constantly cruising through the waves with his trident. Instead of which here he was sitting in the depths of the world’s ocean endlessly going over the accounts, an occasional journey to Jupiter being the only interruption of the monotony, a journey moreover from which he invariably returned in a furious temper. As a result he had hardly seen the oceans, save fleetingly during his hasty ascent to Olympus, and had never really sailed upon them. He used to say that he was postponing this until the end of the world, for then there might come a quiet moment when, just before the end and having gone through the last account, he could still make a quick little tour."

    "title": "Disappointment with Amusement",
    "text": "One expected something different, and usually more. When it’s less, that’s annoying, but not always; it still offers something when it doesn’t really matter. Or when it’s really harmless, like a joke, which after all can also amuse when it falls flat—when it sets mountains in motion, as it were, only to bear a mouse.\nAs happened, for example, with that scene at the circus, lots of big words, expectations ever rising. The ring was cleared and nothing less was announced than the battle steed Bucephalos. That was also the name of Alexander the Great’s personal horse. The mighty steel cable was already auspicious by which the ringmaster tried to drag the stallion into the ring. Only tried, of course; the stubborn, unseen something on the other end dragged him forward by the cable, outside, from where one could hear only stamping and angry whinnying. One, two, then three particularly brawny men came to the ringmaster’s aid, pulled expertly at the cable, in vain, could only bring the cable to a standstill. Until a fourth came along and grabbed the cable, a very heavy boxer, come to help them from the next number, and now he finally moved the cable from a standstill and pulled it ever more back.\nA final tug, all together, one could hear the clatter of mighty hoofs outside, triumph—and a wooden horse was visible at the end of the cable, rolled into the ring on its four wheels. The audience now laughed with relief at this great sight gag, laughed wholeheartedly, as we like to say. And not at all so disappointed at such a Bucephalos at the end of the tether. Even objectively, it was rather relieved by the humor, perhaps also because anticipation is not only joyful, but much more often fearful—and look, there was nothing to it! At least not in fairy tales; or even when something less childish comes, does not come out like a wooden horse, nevertheless fairy tales, the circus, all the way up to farce, all mean that the soup is always cooler when you eat it than when it was boiling. Whereas in the life as we still have it, the cooks in charge expect us to eat the soup even hotter."

I didn’t ask this because I felt obliged to ask something; it was the place and my memory that sparked the question.

The whole of my irrational good mood abruptly died, like the eternally missing barber from the adjacent chair. A chill swept over all my thoughts. I said nothing.\nNostalgia! I even feel it for people and things that were nothing to me, because time’s fleeing is for me an anguish, and life’s mystery is a torture.

All the decisive blows are struck left-handed.\nAt the beginning of the long downhill lane that leads to the house of———, whom I visited each evening, is a gate. After she moved, the opening of its archway henceforth stood before me like an ear that has lost the power of hearing.\nA child in his nightshirt cannot be prevailed upon to greet an arriving visitor. Those present, invoking a higher moral standpoint, admonish him in vain to overcome his prudery. A few minutes later he reappears, now stark naked, before the visitor.

In the same way, the power of a text when it is read is different from the power it has when it is copied out. The airplane passenger sees only how the road pushes through the landscape, how it unfolds according to the same laws as the terrain surrounding it. Only he who walks the road on foot learns of the power it commands, and of how, from the very scenery that for the flier is only the unfurled plain, it calls forth distances, belvederes, clearings, prospects at each of its turns like a commander deploying soldiers at a front. Only the copied text thus commands the soul of him who is occupied with it, whereas the mere reader never discovers the new aspects of his inner self that are opened by the text, that road cut through the interior jungle forever closing behind it: because the reader follows the movement of his mind in the free flight of daydreaming, whereas the copier submits it to command. The Chinese practice of copying books was thus an incomparable guarantee of literary culture, and the transcript a key to China’s enigmas."

    "title": "Rest While Watching the Demolition",
    "text": "Opposite the bistro where I’ve been sitting all day, an old building is being pulled down, a hotel I’ve lived in these past sixteen years—apart from such time as I was away on my travels. Yesterday one wall, the back wall, was still standing, awaiting its final night. The three other walls were already rubble, on the half-fenced-off site. How oddly small the site seemed to me, compared to the big hotel that had formerly occupied the same space! You would have thought, too, that an empty site would appear bigger than one that was built on. But probably it’s the sixteen years, now that they’re over, seeming so precious to me, so full of precious things, that I can’t understand how they could have elapsed in such a small space. And because the hotel is shattered and the years I lived in it have gone, it seems bigger in memory, much bigger than it can have been. On the one remaining wall I could still see the wallpaper in my room, which was sky blue with a fine gold pattern. Then, yesterday, they put up a scaffolding against the wall, and two workers climbed up on it. With pickax and sledgehammer they attacked my wallpaper, my wall; and then, when it was reeling and decrepit, the men tied ropes round the wall—the wall was to be put to death. The workers climbed down, dismantling the scaffolding as they went. The two ends of the rope hung down on either side of the wall. Each man took hold of one end and pulled. And with a crash the wall came down. Everything was obscured by a dense white cloud of plaster dust and mortar. From it emerged, all coated in white dust, like great millers who grind stones, the two men. They made straight for me, as they had been doing twice each day. They’ve known me since I’ve been sitting here. The younger one gestures back over his shoulder with his thumb, and says: It’s gone now, your wall! I asked them both to stop and have a drink with me, more as if they’d been building me a wall. We joked about the wallpaper, the walls, my precious years. The workers were demolition men; knocking things down was their job; they would never think of building anything. And quite right too! they said. Everyone does the job they do, and gets paid the going rate! And this man here is the king of the demolition men, said the younger one. The older one smiled. That’s how cheerful the destroyers were, and I with them.\nNow I’m sitting facing the vacant lot, and hearing the hours go by. You lose one home after another, I say to myself. Here I am, sitting with my wanderer’s staff. My feet are sore, my heart is tired, my eyes are dry. Misery crouches beside me, ever larger and ever gentler; pain takes an interest, becomes huge and kind; terror flutters up, and it doesn’t even frighten me anymore. And that’s the most desolate thing of all.\nUnimaginable things happen, and the hand remains calm and doesn’t clutch at the head. On my right is the little post office; the postman comes out and delivers my letters, bad letters mostly; when the hotel was still standing, he used to leave good letters on my table. A woman comes—one I used to love, and I smile, a shadow of an old smile I used to have, that I no longer miss. An old man shuffles by, wearing a pair of indoor slippers, and I envy him his shuffle and his being an old man. Boisterous customers stand around the bar, arguing. There is a series of unresolvable, albeit not-very-far-reaching differences of opinion between them on such matters as cigarette lighters, radios, racehorses, wives, makes of car, aperitifs, and other such weighty issues. A taxi driver walks in. The waiter brings him a glass of red wine. His taxi’s waiting. The driver drinks his wine. Soon he’s quite alone, facing the landlady across the bar. The waiter balances an empty can on a car tire. The guests laugh. They want me to laugh with them. Why not? I stand up, and I laugh. Who’s that laughing in me? I’ve got misery waiting at my table, large, gentle misery. I won’t be long, I’m just laughing!\nDiagonally across from me is the barber, standing in front of his door, as white as a candle. Soon his customers will arrive, they will arrive at the end of their day’s work, when the newspaper seller comes and brings me the evening papers, the ones that are full of heated skirmishes and cold blood, and that yet—one can’t really believe it—flop rustling home on to the tables on the terrace like huge, exhausted peace doves at the end of their day. All the terror of the world is in them, all the terror of the whole grisly day, that’s what makes them so tired. When the first silvery streetlights glimmer on, a refugee, an exile, sometimes comes along, without a wanderer’s staff, quite as if he were at home here, and—as if he wanted to prove to me in one breath that he felt at home, that he knew his way around, but also that where he felt at home wasn’t home—he says: I know somewhere you can get a good, cheap meal here. And I’m glad for him that he does. I’m glad that he walks off under the trail of silvery streetlights, and doesn’t stop, now that night is falling, to take in the ever-ghost-lier-looking dust on the empty lot opposite. Not everyone has to get used to rubble and to shattered walls.\nThe exile, the displaced person, has taken the newspapers away with him. He wants to read them in his good, cheap restaurant. In front of me the table is empty."

That’s for mice.\nThe crow removed the cheese with his talons and said, You always hate the thing you cannot have, as, for instance, grapes.\nGrapes are for the birds, said the fox haughtily. I am an epicure, a gourmet, and a gastronome.\nThe embarrassed crow, ashamed to be seen eating mouse food by a great specialist in the art of dining, hastily dropped the cheese. The fox caught it deftly, swallowed it with relish, said Merci, politely, and trotted away.\nA fox had used all his blandishments in vain, for he could not flatter the crow in the tree and make him drop the cheese he held in his beak. Suddenly, the crow tossed the cheese to the astonished fox. Just then the farmer, from whose kitchen the loot had been stolen, appeared, carrying a rifle, looking for the robber. The fox turned and ran for the woods. There goes the guilty son of a vixen now! cried the crow, who, in case you do not happen to know it, can see the glint of sunlight on a gun barrel at a greater distance than anybody.This time the fox, who was determined not to be outfoxed by a crow, stood his ground and did not run when the farmer appeared, carrying a rifle and looking for the robber.\nThe teeth marks in this cheese are mine, said the fox, but the beak marks were made by the true culprit up there in the tree. I submit this cheese in evidence, as Exhibit A, and bid you and the criminal a very good day. Whereupon he lit a cigarette and strolled away.\nIn the great and ancient tradition, the crow in the tree with the cheese in his beak began singing, and the cheese fell into the fox’s lap. You sing like a shovel, said the fox, with a grin, but the crow pretended not to hear and cried out, Quick, give me back the cheese! Here comes the farmer with his rifle!\nWhy should I give you back the cheese? the wily fox demanded.\nBecause the farmer has a gun, and I can fly faster than you can run.\nSo the frightened fox tossed the cheese back to the crow, who ate it, and said, Dearie me, my eyes are playing tricks on me or am I playing tricks on you? Which do you think? But there was no reply, for the fox had slunk away into the woods."

    "text": "Men had always wanted her, this Karintha, even as a child, Karintha carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. Old men rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Young men danced with her at frolics when they should have been dancing with their grown-up girls. God grant us youth, secretly prayed the old men. The young fellows counted the time to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them. This interest of the male, who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon, could mean no good to her.\nKarintha, at twelve, was a wild flash that told the other folks just what it was to live. At sunset, when there was no wind, and the pine-smoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth, and you couldn’t see more than a few feet in front, her sudden darting past you was a bit of vivid color, like a black bird that flashes in light. With the other children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping in the two-inch dust. Karintha’s running was a whir. It had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road. At dusk, during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before any of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her voice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one’s ears to itching. But no one ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children . . . Even the preacher, who caught her at her mischief, told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a November cotton flower. Already, rumors were out about her. Homes in Georgia are most often built on the two-room plan. In one, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on. Karintha had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving. One could but imitate one’s parents, for to follow them was the way of God. She played home with a small boy who was not afraid to do her bidding. That started the whole thing. Old men could no longer ride her hobby-horse upon their knees. But young men counted faster.\nKarintha is a woman. She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. She has been married many times. Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Karintha smiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it. She has contempt for them. Karintha is a woman. Young men run stills to make her money. Young men go to the big cities and run on the road. Young men go away to college. They all want to bring her money. These are the young men who thought that all they had to was to count time. But Karintha is a woman, and she has had a child. A child fell out of her womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest. Pine-needles are smooth and sweet. They are elastic to the feet of rabbits . . . A sawmill was nearby. Its pyramidal saw-dust pile smouldered. It is a year before one completely burns. Meanwhile, the smoke curls up and hangs in odd wraiths about the trees, curls up, and spreads itself out over the valley. . . Weeks after Karintha returned home the smoke was so heavy you tasted it in water. Some one made a song:\nKarintha is a woman. Men do not know that the soul of her was a growing thing ripened too soon. They will bring their money; they will die not having found it out . . . Karintha at twenty, carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. Karintha . . ."

I fancied buying some kind of a shirt that was a bit special. Some kind of fantasy shirt.\nI chose one. A sort of sky-blue colour, with two detachable collars. Well, it was every bit as good as imported goods.\nI headed off home as fast as I could. Tried it on. Luxury. A lovely sight. A joy to behold!\nAt the party I thought, the ladies would be throwing themselves at me.\nI should admit, I’m fanatical about cleanliness. There I was trying on the shirt, and somehow I felt uncomfortable. God only knows, I thought. You never know how many people have had their hands all over it. Wouldn’t be a bad idea to get it laundered. We’re only talking about twenty kopecks. Then I could wear it with pleasure.\nI ran over to the laundry woman. She lives in the same yard as me. Lukerya Petrovna.\nMy dear Lukerya Petrovna, I said, please do your best. The party’s tomorrow. I’ve got to have it for tomorrow. Can I rely on you?\nYou can rely on me, she said. Come round, she said, just before the party and you can put your shirt on. It will be washed and pressed, with the two detachable collars.\nThe next day, before the party, I popped round to the laundry woman.\nI took the shirt from her. I ran off to get changed.\nI put the shirt on. But what on earth was this? Some kind of tiny shirt: the collar wouldn’t fit and the cuffs were where the elbows had been. What the hell was going on?\nI quickly hurried back to the laundry woman.\nThe laundry woman said:\nThat’s nothing unusual. It’s only to be expected. New shirts these days always shrink. Either it’s the material they’re made from or the manufacturers don’t wash the fabric. That’s nothing.\nWhat do you mean nothing! It won’t fit round my neck. It used to be, I said, size 38, and now it’s probably a 32.\nThe laundry woman said:\nAnd you can thank your lucky stars for that, she said. The other day I washed one for the accountant, started off size 40 and now he’ll be lucky if it’s a five. The accountant threatened to smash my face in for that, but it’s not my fault.\nDamn it! What, I thought, can I do?\nAnd I didn’t have much time. It was time to go to the party.\nI put the shirt on, and over it, to hide it, I squeezed on my old shirt, so as not to cause offence, and hurried off to the party.\nIt went well. No one noticed. It was OK.\n------\nPAUL COLINET (Belgium, 1898–1957)\nThe Lobster\nThe lobster is a bird on stilts, in the species of nighthawks. He drinks cranially, is well developed, has been pointed out by Linné under the name of Forge Roussel. Its body shows 4/5 generally animal. The hindquarters are composed of a cluster of 17 metal spools, on divergent axles. The lobster is the only carnivorous bird that flies backwards.\nHis characteristic song, which resembles, but is harsher than, the civet-cat’s, is produced by a spur’s vibration in the cranial box, called the sub-machine-gun. The lobster’s calcified eye is used, in shoemaking, to fasten half-boots."

I used to linger endlessly before one of the cages at the zoo; I judged vast encyclopedias and books of natural history by the splendor of their tigers. (I still remember those illustrations: I who cannot rightly recall the brow or the smile of a woman.) Childhood passed away, and the tigers and my passion for them grew old, but still they are in my dreams. At that submerged or chaotic level they keep prevailing. And so, as I sleep, some dream beguiles me, and suddenly I know I am dreaming. Then I think: This is a dream, a pure diversion of my will; and now that I have unlimited power, I am going to cause a tiger.\nOh, incompetence! Never can my dreams engender the wild beast I long for. The tiger indeed appears, but stuffed or flimsy, or with impure variations of shape, or of an implausible size, or all too fleeting, or with a touch of the dog or the bird."

Look, in my hands they are like trembling, nude little children, and I am holding them up to you in the hollow of my hand, as though I were their creator, their father, I have emptied them for you of their power and their mystery. I have tracked down, harried what was miraculous about them.\nNow they hardly differ from the intelligent, curious and amusing eccentrics who come and tell me their interminable stories, to get me to help them, appreciate them, and reassure them.\nYou can no more be affected than my daughters are when they entertain their girl friends in their mother’s parlor, and chatter and laugh gaily without being concerned with what I am saying to my patients in the next room.\nThis was what he taught at the Collège de France. And in the entire neighborhood, in all the nearby Faculties, in the literature, law, history and philosophy courses, at the Institute and at the Palais de Justice, in the buses, the métros, in all the government offices, sensible men, normal men, active men, worthy, wholesome, strong men, triumphed.\nAvoiding the shops filled with pretty things, the women trotting briskly along, the café waiters, the medical students, the traffic policemen, the clerks from notary offices, Rimbaud or Proust, having been torn from life, cast out from life and deprived of support, were probably wandering aimlessly through the streets, or dozing away, their heads resting on their chests, in some dusty public square."

    "text": "How came it about that Mrs. Paradise the dressmaker is here to dress me, and Mr. Babcock the bootmaker to boot me and a whole science of service to serve me, and that I am precisely here to be served? Do not speak to me of economics: that is merely a question of how we arrange matters between us. And do not speak to me of genesis: I am discussing the question of Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and the others as immediate causes of one another, I am not discussing creation. Personally, I do not believe in creation. Creation is stealing one thing to turn it into another. What I am discussing is existence, uncorrupted by art—how came it about, and so forth. Do not speak to me of love: Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and all the others do not like each other, in fact, we dislike each other because each of us is most certainly the cause of the other. I am the reason for Mrs. Paradise’s making frocks and Mrs. Paradise is the reason for my wearing frocks. If it were not for each other we should be occupied only with ourselves; we should not exist. How then came we to exist? I ask this question. Mrs. Paradise asks this question. I am Mrs. Paradise’s answer. Mrs. Paradise is my answer. As for Mr. Babcock, he has hair on his nose and I never look at him. As for all the others, I must put up a notice asking them to ring the bell gently.\nThere is a woman in this city who loathes me. There are people everywhere who loathe me. I could name them; if they were in a book I could turn to the exact page. People who loathe me do so for one of two reasons: because I have frightened them because I have loathed them (that is, made my death-face at them, which I shall not describe as it might in this way lose some of its virtue) or because they are interested in me and there seems no practical way of (or excuse for) satisfying their interest. As to love, that is another matter—it has nothing to do with either interest or fear. Love is simply a matter of history, beginning like cancer from small incidents. There is nothing further to be said about it.\nBut as to loathing: I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me. Further than this, I know what they mean, I sympathize with them, I understand them. There should be a name (as poetic as love) for this relationship between loather and loathed; it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest.\nTo continue about this woman. What is to her irritation is to me myself. She has therefore a very direct sense of me, as I have a very direct sense of her, from being a kind of focus of her nervous system. There is no sentiment, no irony between us, nothing but feeling: it is an utterly serious relationship.\nFor if one eat my meat, though it be known\nThe meat was mine, the excrement is his own.\nI forget in what context these words were used by Donne—but they express very accurately how organic I feel this relationship to be. The tie between us is as positive as the tie between twins is negative. I think of her often. She is a painter—not a very good painter. I understand this too: it is difficult to explain, but quite clear to myself that one of the reasons I am attached to her is that she is not a good painter. Also her clothes, which do not fit her well: this again makes me even more attached to her. If she knew this she would be exasperated against me all the more, and I should like it; not because I want to annoy her but because this would make our relationship still more intense. It would be terrible to me if we ever became friends; like a divorce."

Nearly always quiet, or when paired with another professor speaking in measured tones, his voice strong and resonant, but most of the time alone in his cell, where he kept a few secular books mixed in with the religious ones, and from which I could see in springtime the green leaves and dark fruit of a mulberry tree climbing the wall and covering the gloomy little patio his window opened on.\nOne day in class he tried to read us some verses, his voice aglow with heartfelt enthusiasm, and it must have been hard for him to understand the mockery, veiled at first, then open and hostile, of the students—because he admired poetry and its art, in a pedantic way, naturally. It was he who tried to get me to recite sometimes, although a shyness stronger than pleasure froze my delivery; he who encouraged me to write my first poems, critiquing them then and giving me as an esthetic precept what in my literary papers would always be a graceful hold on the material.\nHe put me at the head of the class, a distinction for which I soon paid with a certain unpopularity among my schoolmates, and before final exams, as if understanding my diffidence and lack of confidence, he told me: Go to the chapel and pray. That will give you courage.\nOnce I got to the university, in my self-absorption I stopped going to see him. One deep gold morning in fall, on my way to my early first class, I saw a poor little funeral turning the corner, the red brick wall of the school, which I’d forgotten; it was his. It was my heart, without hearing from anyone else, that told me so. He must have died alone. I don’t know how he held up through those last days of his life."

    "text": "Nowadays habit has killed the joy in big dinners on New Year’s Eve: for many years the same elements have conspired to produce a happiness which has been enjoyed too often. Everyone knows in advance the precise mechanism of events.\nFamily memories, felicitations and forecasts roll out like newspapers from presses. Old habits must be cast off to escape this monotony.\nThere are a thousand ways to revitalize this occasion: here is one which we put to the test with the Futursimultaneists in Rome: Mattia, Belli, D’Avila, Pandolfo, Battistella, Vignazia, etc.\nAt midnight after the endless chit-chat of waiting it is announced that dinner is served. In the dining room the tables have been removed and the guests are seated on chairs placed in a row, Indian file, one behind the other.\nThe inevitable turkey arrives, served by the waiters on metal plates: the turkey is stuffed with mandarins and salami.\nEveryone eats in compulsory silence: the desire for noise and jollity is suppressed.\nThen suddenly a live turkey is let loose in the room, and it flounders about in terror, to the surprise of the men and the squeals of the women who can’t understand this resurrection of the food they’ve just eaten. Order is reestablished and everyone puts away his momentarily uncontained joy.\nBeaten by the silence, in an attempt to start any sort of conversation one of those present says:\nI haven’t yet expressed my good wishes for the New Year.\nThen as if following an order they all jump up and hurl themselves against the unwary conservator of tradition, whom they pummel repeatedly. Finally, happiness, exasperated by too much inaction, explodes and the guests disperse about the house, the most daring invading the kitchen.\nThe cook and two waiters are removed by force and everyone sets to thinking up a way of varying the meal. A fierce competition between the hot ovens, while frying pans and saucepans pass from hand to hand amidst laughter, shouts and a rain of ingredients.\nMeanwhile others have discovered the wine cellar and thus an exceptional banquet is put together, which goes from kitchen to bedroom, from entrance hall to bathroom, to cellar. The dishes, put together almost by magic, follow one upon the other in the spirit of speed and harmony that animates the new cooks.\nA guest tells the owner of the house:\nFifteen years ago, on this same date . . .\nBut that same moment he is presented with a bowl full of spumante with cauliflowers, slices of lemon and roast beef floating in it: the memory of the past is shipwrecked in a stunning present.\nThe youngest guests shout:\nBury your memories! We must start the year in a quite different way from the pre-war banquets!\nThree gramophones function as tables and from on top of the records, which have become rotating plates, people pluck little sugar-coated candies, cylinders of Parmesan cheese and hard-boiled eggs, while three different rhythms of Japanese music accompany the dynamic service.\nThe owner of the house suddenly turns out the lights. Stupefaction. In the darkness the voice of one of the guests is heard:\nThis year we will succeed in breaking through the envelope of the atmosphere and reach the planets. I invite you all to a banquet next New Year’s Eve on the moon, where we will finally taste foods of a flavour unknown to our palates and unimaginable drinks!\nFormula by the Futurist Aeropainter"

    "title": "The Old Darned Man",
    "text": "Back in the thirties, in the midst of the Depression, I fled the city and moved to a Connecticut farm. It was the period of my first marriage. We lived in an old gambrel house, built about 1740, on top of a ridge called Wormwood Hill. I had bought the house, together with more than 100 acres of woodland and pasture, for $500 down. It had no electricity, no heat, no running water, and it was in bad repair, but it was a great, beautiful house. I spent most of three years, working with my hands, making it habitable. At that time early American art and furniture were practically being given away. Poor as we were, we managed to fill the house with priceless stuff. We were so far from the city and from all signs of progress that we might as well have been living in another age.\nOne spring there appeared on the road, climbing up the hill, a man in a patchwork suit, with a battered silk hat on his head. His trousers and swallow-tail coat had been mended so many times, with varicolored swatches, that when he approached us, over the brow of the hill, he looked like a crazyquilt on stilts.\nHe was an itinerant tinker, dried-out and old, thin as a scarecrow, with a high, cracked voice. He asked for pots and pans to repair, scissors and knives to sharpen. In the shade of the sugar maples, that a colonel in Washington’s army was said to have planted, he set up his shop and silently went to work on the articles I handed to him.\nWhen he was done, I offered him lunch in the kitchen. He would not sit down to eat, but accepted some food in a bag. I have been here before, he said to me quietly. On our way out, while we were standing in the front hall at the foot of the staircase, he suddenly cried, I hear the worms tumbling in this house. What do you mean? I asked. He did not answer, but cupped his hands over his eyes. I took it as a bad omen, a fateful prophecy, about my house, my marriage. And so it turned out to be.\nSome time later I learned that my visitor was a legendary figure, known throughout the countryside as the Old Darned Man. He had been a brilliant divinity student at Yale, engaged to a childhood sweetheart, with the wedding set for the day after graduation. But on that very day, while he waited at the church, the news was brought to him that she had run off with his dearest friend. Ever since then he had been wandering distractedly from village to village in his wedding clothes.\nAs for the worms, they belonged to a forgotten page in local history. Late in the nineteenth century the housewives of the region, dreaming of a fortune to be made, had started a cottage industry in silkworm culture, importing the worms from China. The parlors of every farmhouse were lined with stacks of silkworm trays, in which the worms munched on mulberry leaves, making clicking and whispering noises. That was the sound heard in my hall.\nIt’s a story without a happy ending. The worms died; the dreams of riches faded; abandoned plows rusted in the farmyards; one breathless summer day a black-funneled twister wheeled up Wormwood Hill from the stricken valley, dismantling my house, my barn, my grove of sugar maples; the face of my bride darkened and broke into a wild laughter; I never saw the Old Darned Man again."

    "text": "He was found lying on the ground. No one had missed him. No one was looking for him. An old woman found him. To put it vaguely. It happened so long ago. She was straying in search of wild flowers. Yellow only. With no eyes but for these she stumbled on him lying there. He lay face downward and arms outspread. He wore a greatcoat in spite of the time of year. Hidden by the body a long row of buttons fastened it all the way down. Buttons of all shapes and sizes. Worn upright the skirts swept the ground. That seems to hang together. Near the head a hat lay askew on the ground. At once on its brim and crown. He lay inconspicuous in the greenish coat. To catch an eye searching from afar there was only the white head. May she have seen him somewhere before? Somewhere on his feet before? Not too fast. She was all in black. The hem of her long black skirt trailed in the grass. It was close of day. Should she now move away into the east her shadow would go before. A long black shadow. It was lambing time. But there were no lambs. She could see none. Were a third party to chance that way theirs were the only bodies he would see. First that of the old woman standing. Then on drawing near it lying on the ground. That seems to hang together. The deserted fields. The old woman all in black stock-still. The body stockstill on the ground. Yellow at the end of the black arm. The white hair in the grass. The east foundering in night. Not too fast. The weather. Sky overcast all day till evening. In the west-north-west near the verge already the sun came out at last. Rain? A few drops if you will. A few drops in the morning if you will. In the present to conclude. It happened so long ago. Cooped indoors all day she comes out with the sun. She makes haste to gain the fields. Surprised to have seen no one on the way she strays feverishly in search of the wild flowers. Feverishly seeing the imminence of night. She remarks with surprise the absence of lambs in great numbers here at this time of year. She is wearing the black she took on when widowed young. It is to reflower the grave she strays in search of the flowers he had loved. But for the need of yellow at the end of the black arm there would be none. There are therefore only as few as possible. This is for her the third surprise since she came out. For they grow in plenty here at this time of year. Her old friend her shadow irks her. So much so that she turns to face the sun. Any flower wide of her course she reaches sidelong. She craves for sundown to end and to stray freely again in the long after-glow. Further to her distress the familiar rustle of her long black skirt in the grass. She moves with half-closed eyes as if drawn on into the glare. She may say to herself it is too much strangeness for a single March or April evening. No one abroad. Not a single lamb. Scarcely a flower. Shadow and rustle irksome. And to crown all the shock of her foot against a body. Chance. No one had missed him. No one was looking for him. Black and green of the garments touching now. Near the white head the yellow of the few plucked flowers. The old sunlit face. Tableau vivant if you will. In its way. All is silent from now on. For as long as she cannot move. The sun disappears at last and with it all shadow. All shadow here. Slow fade of afterglow. Night without moon or stars. All that seems to hang together. But no more about it"

    "text": "I’ve always felt like a nothing, having in my final resting place such a neighbor as van Gogh, who, I have been assured by several inhabitants of St. Rémy, was an impassioned painter, if a little unreliable. He would take long walks at night, disappearing among thick cypresses, which, however, could be easily approached by the swift stars. Or he would stir up a mistral with the cumbersome presence of his easel, his palette and his wild bundles of canvases. Thus saddled, he packed himself off to the vicinity of Montmajour, a ruin known for its perils. Arles and Les Baux, the country threading toward the Rhone, were also the settings for meanderings and sudden spurts of work by a vaguely suspicious artist, if you judged by his eyes and his red bristle without grasping the truth.\nIt was only later that a smokescreen of explanations was hurled forth about him: This frequenter of the brothel of Arles was in fact a decent man, who was taken in a demented state to the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole just a few hundred yards from Glanum, then still a buried city, but hinted at by a cradle-shaped arc, which van Gogh had painted with the utmost skill in one of his works. I understood, in looking at his drawings, that he had up to that time worked, and only for us. And why not add to this story something which occurred in another space and time?\nThis countryside, down to the belly of its grasshoppers, was fully communicated to us by a hand and a wrist. From what cauldron and from what paradise did Vincent van Gogh surge? From what great suffering did he produce those pebbles, those irises and those marshes, those narrow roads, those farms, that wheat, those vines, that river? Sublime work! In another century, locked behind the iron bars of several misfortunes, my own life tracked me down in a similar terrain! I realized this and tried to barter with Vincent’s profound vision, but while his eyes were enriched by their truth, their novel flowers, mine were wounded, not gladdened, by melting snow. A dog I loved no longer seemed to feel obliged to respond to my call; in the same way the earth hung back, hesitant about man’s approaching destiny."

It was so interesting to be moving, to give the horses their rein, and wait until, in the next valley, a village slowly appeared, or a park with the white spot of a manor in it. And always we were barked at by a dog, assiduous in its duty. That was the beginning of the century; this is its end. I have been thinking not only of the people who lived there once but also of the generations of dogs accompanying them in their everyday bustle, and one night—I don’t know where it came from—in a pre-dawn sleep, that funny and tender phrase composed itself: a road-side dog."

He had removed all the seats and put in a table and chairs so that the car was like a small furnished room with books, a vase with flowers and so forth. One day he drove up to a luncheonette, parked, opened the door on the street side, unrolled a red carpet across the sidewalk. Then he walked on the carpet, went in, and ordered a hamburger. Meanwhile a crowd gathered, expecting something strange to happen. However, all Graves did was eat the hamburger, pay his bill, get back in the car, roll up the carpet, and drive off."

    "text": "The extraordinary telephony from the central fire to galaxies installed in one second and by what orders! The rain, it’s the testy way here and now to strike out everything that exists, everything that’s been created, cried out, said, lied about, soiled. Where on earth did you hear that rain falls?\nIt is the courage of men which is dislocated. Rain is always wholehearted. Rain exults. It is a levy en masse of inspiration, a jolt of tropical sleep; a forward of lympths; a frenzy of caterpillars and faculae; a tumultuous assault against everything that burrows in warrens; the thrust counter-current to gravity of a thousand crazed rounds of ammunition and the tur-ra-mas that jump as they advance—sea horses toward the finallys and the suburbs.\nFinally! The tree bursts with grenade. The rock explodes. Tenderness: now and then this great repose. Tenderness: now and then this orchestra playing and intertwining steps like plaited wicker.\nTenderness, but that of adorable tortures: the setting in motion of a fire of bit-braces which drill and force the void to scream star. It is blood. Moreover it is hard to understand how it is enough to feed the extraordinary devolution of horses which from ridge to ridge turn back on the momentum of the ravines.\nNo more monarchy. And it is perpetual this invention of ecstatic chants, of abbreviated prayers, of meticulous spider ceremonials, of saws which splash about, of unknotted hair, of enameled glass mosque lamps which collide, of seas which flow and ebb, of an alembic, of worms which at full steam trumpet unforgettable condensations.\nUnforgettable indeed. An assagai dance the likes of which has never been seen and ten thousand victory flags torn from the cetaceans and waved by the earth.\nThe vineyard of wrath has peddled to the very sky the alcohol of its repose and its salvation."

I’m leaving right now to find another place to eat in, a bit more congenial than this silence, with no one to witness that I ordered exactly what I say I did. But now the door is closed and I can’t leave.\nWill someone please open the door, the one who gave me the ham and eggs instead of a sandwich? If I’m dissatisfied and want to leave why must I stay? Can the proprietor do as he pleases with anyone on his property? Am I his property too? What do you know! I have to eat what’s given me or go hungry. I have to be nice about it too and say thank you to the silence. But I want to know why I can’t have what I want that’s such an innocent wish as between a sandwich and a plate of ham and eggs?

I never even got a passport to come. I don’t remember leaving. I don’t remember crossing the border and I’m the only guy here at the counter. Something phony is going on. Somebody is trying to drive me nuts or rob me or kill me. I want to go back where I came from. I was on the road hungry, driving. It was dark and I hadn’t eaten my dinner.\nYou know, it’s quite possible I made these ham and eggs myself instead of a sandwich. It may be I’m the owner because no one else is here and I have the key to open the door, exactly like my car key. I must have arranged it that way.

He would order a cup of coffee, light a cigarette, listen to the chatter, sip his coffee, pay the waiter, take his hat, grab his case, say good afternoon, and leave. And so it was every day.\nWhat did don Pedro say upon sitting and rising, with serious face and hard eyes? He said:\nDon Pedro repeated the phrase many times each day. Upon rising, upon completing his morning preparations, upon entering and leaving his house—at eight o’clock, at one, at two-thirty, at seven-forty—in the café, in the office, before and after every meal, when going to bed each night. He repeated it between his teeth or in a loud voice, alone or with others. Sometimes with only his eyes. Always with all his soul.\nNo one knew to whom he addressed these words. Everyone ignored the origin of his hate. When someone wanted to dig deeper into the story, don Pedro would turn his head with disdain and fall silent, modest. Perhaps it was a causeless hate, a pure hate. But the feeling nourished him, gave seriousness to his life, majesty to his years. Dressed in black, he seemed to be prematurely mourning for his victim.\nOne afternoon don Pedro arrived graver than usual. He sat down heavily, and, in the center of the silence that was created by his presence, he simply dropped these words:\nWho and how? Some smiled, wanting to the take the thing as a joke. Don Pedro’s look stopped them. All of us felt uncomfortable. That sense of the void of death was certain. Slowly the group dispersed. Don Pedro remained alone, more serious than ever, a little withered, like a burnt-out star, but tranquil, without remorse.\nHe did not return the next day. He never returned. Did he die? Maybe he needed that life-giving hate. Maybe he still lives and now hates another. I examine my actions, and advise you to do the same. Perhaps you too have incurred the same obstinate, patient anger of those small myopic eyes. Have you ever thought how many—perhaps very close to you—watch you with the same eyes as don Pedro?"

As though to an enchanted castle, all roads to it are barred and over each one hangs a forbidding sign—a plain, blunt straight line.\nMan or beast, faced by that sign, must turn back. Some earthly power has put that sign there; past it none may ride, none may walk, crawl, or even fly.\nGuards with swords and pistols lurk beside the path in the nearby pine grove.\nYou may circle and circle the silent wood searching for a way through to the lake, but you will find none and there will be no one to ask, for no one goes into this wood. They have all been frightened away. Your only chance to venture through will be one afternoon in the rain along a cattle track, in the wake of the dull clink of a cowbell. And from your first glimpse of it, vast and shimmering between the tree trunks, you know before you reach its banks that you will be in thrall to this place for the rest of your life.\nSegden Lake is as round as though traced out with a pair of compasses. If you were to shout from one side (but you must not shout, or you will be heard), only a fading echo would reach the other bank. It is a long way across. Woods immure the lakeside entirely, a dense forest of row upon unbroken row of trees. As you come out of the wood to the water’s edge, you can see the whole of the forbidden shore: here a strip of yellow sand, there a grey stubble of reeds, there a lush swathe of grass. The water is smooth, calm, and unruffled, and apart from some patches of weed by the shore, the white lake bed gleams through the translucent water.\nA secret lake in a secret forest. The water looks up and the sky gazes down upon it. If there is a world beyond the forest, it is unknown, invisible; if it exists, it has no place here.\nHere is somewhere to settle forever, a place where a man could live in harmony with the elements and be inspired.\nBut it cannot be. An evil prince, a squint-eyed villain, has claimed the lake for his own: there is his house, there is his bathing place. His evil brood goes fishing here, shoots duck from his boat. First a wisp of blue smoke above the lake, then a moment later the shot.\nAway beyond the woods, the people sweat and heave, whilst all the roads leading here are closed lest they intrude. Fish and game are bred for the villain’s pleasure. Here there are traces where someone lit a fire but it was put out and he was driven away."

I was leaning towards mother, I was kissing her, incestuously, and then, out of the house. A huge swarm of large black butterflies, in from the tropics, thwarted my advance. Rafael dragged me after him and we descended in the direction of the railway tracks. Under foot I felt the tracks, heard the whistle of a locomotive, very near, my heart tightened. The train rattled over our heads.\nI opened my eyes. In front of me, across a huge expanse, stood a vast candelabra with thousands of arms.—Is it gold?! I whispered to Rafael.—Gold. You’ll crawl up one of the arms, so that, then, when I have lifted it up into the heavens, you’ll hook it up to the sky. Before the break of dawn, people will be able to save themselves, flying there. I’ll show them the way, and you’ll welcome them.\nI crawled up one of the arms, Rafael was shifting from one arm to the other, was touching them one after the other, the candelabra began to lift. A leaf fell on my forehead, on the very spot my friend had touched with his gaze, a maple leaf. I look all around: this cannot be the sky. Hours pass and I haven’t found anything.

    "title": "The Fifth Story",
    "text": "This story could be called The Statues. Another possible title would be The Killing. Or even How to Kill Cockroaches. So I shall tell at least three stories, all of them true, because none of the three will contradict the others. Although they constitute one story, they could become a thousand and one, were I to be granted a thousand and one nights.\nThe first story, How To Kill Cockroaches, begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches. A woman heard me complain. She gave me a recipe for killing them. I was to mix together equal quantities of sugar, flour and gypsum. The flour and sugar would attract the cockroaches, the gypsum would dry up their insides. I followed her advice. The cockroaches died.\nThe next story is really the first, and it is called The Killing. It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches. A woman heard me complain. The recipe follows. And then the killing takes place. The truth is that I had only complained in abstract terms about the cockroaches, for they were not even mine: they belonged to the ground floor and climbed up the pipes in the building into our apartment. It was only when I prepared the mixture that they also became mine. On our behalf, therefore, I began to measure and weigh ingredients with greater concentration. A vague loathing had taken possession of me, a sense of outrage. By day, the cockroaches were invisible and no one would believe in the evil secret which eroded such a tranquil household. But if the cockroaches, like evil secrets, slept by day, there I was preparing their nightly poison. Meticulous, eager, I prepared the elixir of prolonged death. An angry fear and my own evil secret guided me. Now I coldly wanted one thing only: to kill every cockroach in existence. Cockroaches climb up the pipes while weary people sleep. And now the recipe was ready, looking so white. As if I were dealing with cockroaches as cunning as myself, I carefully spread the powder until it looked like part of the surface dust. From my bed, in the silence of the apartment, I imagined them climbing up one by one into the kitchen where darkness slept, a solitary towel alert on the clothes-line. I awoke hours later, startled at having overslept. It was beginning to grow light. I walked across the kitchen. There they lay on the floor of the scullery, huge and brittle. During the night I had killed them. On our behalf, it was beginning to grow light. On a nearby hill, a cockerel crowed.\nThe third story which now begins is called The Statues. It begins by saying that I had been complaining about the cockroaches. Then the same woman appears on the scene. And so it goes on to the point where I awake as it is beginning to grow light, and I awake still feeling sleepy and I walk across the kitchen. Even more sleepy is the scullery floor with its tiled perspective. And in the shadows of dawn, there is a purplish hue which distances everything; at my feet, I perceive patches of light and shade, scores of rigid statues scattered everywhere. The cockroaches that have hardened from core to shell. Some are lying upside down. Others arrested in the midst of some movement that will never be completed. In the mouths of some of the cockroaches, there are traces of white powder. I am the first to observe the dawn breaking over Pompei. I know what this night has been, I know about the orgy in the dark. In some, the gypsum has hardened as slowly as in some organic process, and the cockroaches, with ever more tortuous movements, have greedily intensified the night’s pleasures, trying to escape from their insides. Until they turn to stone, in innocent terror and with such, but such an expression of pained reproach. Others— suddenly assailed by their own core, without even having perceived that their inner form was turning to stone!—these are suddenly crystallized, just like a word arrested on someone’s lips: I love . . . The cockroaches, invoking the name of love in vain, sang on a summer’s night. While the cockroach over there, the one with the brown antennae smeared with white, must have realized too late that it had become mummified precisely because it did not know how to use things with the gratuitous grace of the in vain: It is just that I looked too closely inside myself! it is just that I looked too closely inside . . .—from my frigid height as a human being, I watch the destruction of a world. Dawn breaks. Here and there, the parched antennae of dead cockroaches quiver in the breeze. The cockerel from the previous story crows.\nThe fourth story opens a new era in the household. The story begins as usual: I was complaining about the cockroaches. It goes on up to the point when I see the statues in plaster of Paris. Inevitably dead. I look towards the pipes where this same night an infestation will reappear, swarming slowly upwards in Indian file. Should I renew the lethal sugar every night? like someone who no longer sleeps without the avidity of some rite. And should I take myself somnambulant out to the terrace early each morning? in my craving to encounter the statues which my perspiring night has erected. I trembled with depraved pleasure at the vision of my double existence as a witch. I also trembled at the sight of that hardening gypsum, the depravity of existence which would shatter my internal form.\nThe grim moment of choosing between two paths, which I thought would separate, convinced that any choice would mean sacrificing either myself or my soul. I chose. And today I secretly carry a plaque of virtue in my heart: This house has been disinfected.\nThe fifth story is called Leibnitz and The Transcendence of Love in Polynesia. . . It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches."

    "text": "This thoughtful and pointlessly melancholy man has been living for many years, by now, in the basement, because the house that rose above it has been destroyed or is uninhabitable. When the religious wars broke out, he had hoped it was a question—he was a foreigner in that country and practiced another religion—of the customary depravities to which that region’s inhabitants were inclined, all of them sanguineous of dying in some noisy and exhibitionistic way, and of killing others with particular cruelty. He bore no love for that country, where he lived as the secretary to the ambassador of another country, where wars of religion were not waged. His country fought atheistic wars, scientifically based. At the moment when the wars of religion had broken out, the secretary had been unable to return to his native land, where a ferocious scientific war was then underway: a war concerned, at least in origin, with hexagons and acids, but which bit by bit had then expanded to the inclusion of nearly all the disciplines, with the sole exclusion of ancient history. Now, the secretary, whom you see in sober dress, has been said, in generic terms, to practice another religion, but there is also the possibility that he practices none at all. What his country most respects is allegiance to ideals upon scientific bases; he himself, however, has no great love of science, and if he had to choose a field in which to specialize, ancient history would be his choice. But since this is the only non-controversial subject, choosing it would have been regarded as suspect, and derided as cowardly. He would have been put to death. Fortuitously, the outbreak of the religious war had allowed him to give no response to requests for clarification that had come from his homeland, but at the very same time he had definitively exiled himself in the country of religious wars. For years he had ventured no more than a few dozen yards from his cellar; he was probably the only foreigner left in a country where massacre was pandemic, and becoming pedantic; a country that no longer had cities, but picturesque expanses of ruins awaiting the death of the last combatant, so as then to grow ivy-covered and be transported into History. Though he had never admitted it in so many words, he liked to live in that territory precisely for its being the theater of a war that was alien to him. So History was none of his doing, but was something perceived as a rumble to which he had grown accustomed; as a lover of ancient history and dead languages, he too looked forward to living—as had always been his dream—in a country made only and entirely of ruins among grasses that have no history."

What’s the difference if Marcello sets the libretto or not?\nNone, he said. But you write a libretto and then let’s just see if you’d prefer to have it set or not. I’d like Marcello to set it, and Ronconi to direct it, and for there to be simultaneous performances outdoors above the Canal in Venice and at the Metropolitan Opera. That’s what I want.\nWhen I heard my wife’s voice on the telephone, calling me in Venice from New York City, I knew that someone must have died. We didn’t phone each other now about ordinary things.\nVenice. The cemetery. Walking around. Arm in arm, sometimes. Occasionally, hand in hand. Her eyes look up. His look down. They look down together. A grave.\nEvening. Later. The shine of plates. The smile of knives and of forks.\nHotel. Stone balcony. Opposite church. Great big faces. Almost in the room. Stone they stare at them with their own face. And yet since it is Carnival he and she put on masks. One red mask his. One black mask hers. This is happiness. There is no other. Cold water faucet. A slight pain in the chest.\nShe takes. Opposite church. To miss what massive. Increasing silence. Man at the desk. Woman at the desk.\nDream band. Marchers off the street. Canal-side restaurant. No more eels! Isthmuses of islands.\nI have. I have a reason. I have a reason to be sad. Here is a reason to be joyful. A grass turf. A striped day. But, most of all, this girl.\nIt became what it began to be: a cemetery. An island dedicated to the dead.\nBlack were the gondolas in the canals, and black the clothing that the gondoliers wore. Black were the buttons on the coat that he did not put on, to go out, because it was spring. Black were the steps on the stairway when he first came to them, blinded by the sun. And then his body went off.\nAgain said Marcello, I said I won’t set it and I won’t. It’s too complicated. A librettist in writing should seek only to inspire the writing of music. You haven’t done that.\nI have more friends than you, Marcello, I said.\nAh, but they don’t set libretti, Marcello said. But if I don’t set it, of course you are free to give it to someone else. But here. Let me look at it one last time.\nAt this point I woke up. The complicated dream was at an end. Actually, Morton had died, and I was walking around thinking, thinking, whether I wanted to or not. Thinking neither of Morton nor of the opera but of you."

There’s a quiver in the dead flesh: My God, he’s still alive. And a shock goes through me, as if a wall of my room had fallen away.\nHis head is arched back, the small eyes closed; the whiskers sometimes rise and fall. He is dying. This is the oil. Here on its back is the oil that heats our houses so efficiently. Wind blows fine sand back toward the ocean. The flipper near me lies folded over the stomach, looking like an unfinished arm, lightly glazed with sand at the edges. The other flipper lies half underneath. And the seal’s skin looks like an old overcoat, scratched here and there—by sharp mussel shells maybe.\nI reach out and touch him. Suddenly he rears up, turns over. He gives three cries: Awaark! Awaark! Awaark!—like the cries from Christmas toys. He lunges toward me; I am terrified and leap back, though I know there can be no teeth in that jaw. He starts flopping toward the sea. But he falls over, on his face. He does not want to go back to the sea. He looks up at the sky, and he looks like an old lady who has lost her hair. He puts his chin back down on the sand, rearranges his flippers, and waits for me to go. I go.\nThe next day I go back to say good-bye. He’s dead now. But he’s not. He’s a quarter mile farther up the shore. Today he is thinner, squatting on his stomach, head out. The ribs show much more: each vertebra on the back under the coat is visible, shiny. He breathes in and out.\nA wave comes in, touches his nose. He turns and looks at me—the eyes slanted; the crown of his head looks like a boy’s leather jacket bending over some bicycle bars. He is taking a long time to die. The whiskers white as porcupine quills, the forehead slopes. . . . Goodbye, brother, die in the sound of the waves. Forgive us if we have killed you. Long live your race, your inner-tube race, so uncomfortable on land, so comfortable in the ocean. Be comfortable in death then, when the sand will be out of your nostrils, and you can swim in long loops through the pure death, ducking under as assassinations break above you. You don’t want to be touched by me. I climb the cliff and go home the other way."

I forgot to tell you your hat looked perky.\nA new way of falling asleep has been discovered. Senior citizens snoop around to impose that sleep. You awake feeling refreshed but something has changed. Perhaps it’s the children singing too much. Sophie shouldn’t have taken them to the concert. I pleaded with her at the time, to no avail. Also, they have the run of the yard. Someone else might want to use it, or have it be empty. All the chairs were sat on in one night.\nAnd I was pale and restless. The actors walked with me to the cabins. I knew that someone was about to lose or destroy my life’s work, or invention. Yet something urged calm on me.\nThere is an occasional friend left, yes. Married men, hand to mouth. I went down to the exhibition. We came back and listened to some records. Strange, I hadn’t noticed the lava pouring. But it’s there, she said, every night of the year, like a river. I guess I notice things less now than I used to, when I was young.\nAnd the arbitrariness of so much of it, like sheep’s wool from a carding comb. You can’t afford to be vigilant, she said. You must stay this way, always, open and vulnerable. Like a body cavity. Then if you are noticed it will be too late to file the architectural pants. We must, as you say, keep in touch. Not to be noticed. If it was for this I was born, I murmured under my breath. What have I been doing around here, all this month? Waiting for the repairman, I suppose.\nWhere were you when the last droplets dribbled? Fastening my garter belt to my panty hose. The whole thing was over in less time than you could say Jack Robinson and we were back at base camp, one little thing after another gone wrong, yet on the whole life is spiritual. Still, it is time to pull up stakes. Probably we’ll meet a hooded stranger on the path who will point out a direction for us to take, and that will be okay too, interesting even if it’s boring.\nI remember the world of cherry blossoms looking up at the sun and wondering, what have I done to deserve this or anything else?"

    "text": "The muscles which move the eyeballs, we are told, derive from a musculature which once occupied the body end to end. Sunblaze as day goes, and the light blots back the scene to iris the half-shut lashes. A look can no longer extricate the centre of the skyline copse. But the last greys, the departing glows caught by the creepers bearding its mass, prevail on the half-blinded retina. Branches deal with the air, vibrating the beams that thread into one’s eye. So that ‘over there’ and ‘in here’ compound a truce neither signed—a truce that, insensibly and categorically, grows to a decree, and what one hoped for and what one is, must measure themselves against those demands which the eye receives, delivering its writ on us through a musculature which occupies the body end to end."

He used to sit on his front porch swing, enraged and helpless, while his two tiny grandchildren, hilarious and hellish little boys, scampered just out of his reach and yelled hideously, Hell on you, Grandpa. His unbelievable Adam’s apple purpled and shone like the burl on the root of a white oak, and he sang his God Damns in despair.\nOld Bud Romick has fallen asleep as the twilight comes down Pearl Street in Martins Ferry, Ohio. The window shutters close here and there, and the flowing streetcars glow past into silence, their wicker seats empty, for the factory whistles have all blown down, and the widows all gone home. Empty, too, are the cinder alleys, smelling of warm summer asphalt. The streetlight columns, faintly golden, fill with the cracked mirrors of June bugs’ wings. Old Bud Romick sags still on the porch swing. The rusty chains do their best for his body in the dark.\nThe dark turns around him, a stain like the bruise on a plum somebody somehow missed and left under a leaf. His two hellions have long since giggled their way upstairs. Old Bud Romick is talking lightly in his sleep, and an evening shower brings him a sticky new sycamore leaf in his sleep.\nWhether or not he is aware of leaves, I don’t know. I don’t know whether or not he is aware of anything touching his face. Whether or not he dreams of how slender sycamores are, how slender young women are when they walk beneath the trees without caring how green they are, how lucky a plum might be if it dies without being eaten, I don’t know."

They appear to be students and he remembers his own youth: the hitch-hiking, the overnight buses, the post war cafés, his digs, the girls for whom he yearned, his incoherence, his shame, even the occasional moments of camaraderie or happiness, piercing him even yet by their intensity and brevity.\nSearch though he may, he can find nothing durable for which he might have nostalgia, until it comes to him: their ability to sleep, curled up oblivious, while the world crashes forward about their ears.\nA man stands waving goodbye to his grandson as a train pulls out of a station, the same from which he left when he had come to visit his own grandfather at the same age, now a lifetime away. Indeed, he has no articulate memory of his grandfather who died shortly after, and certainly none of that last goodbye. This had always been a sorrow, that so poignant a moment should be gone for ever.\nBut as he walks up into the town, he feels no loss at the realisation that his own grandson might scarcely remember, perhaps not at all, and so becomes aware of his grandfather in another way, more intense than any memory, more intense even than the image of that little boy waving to him through the still receding window.\nA woman has devoted her life to her family. One evening at the table as her husband talks of his day at work and the children of their friends at school, she picks up her half finished meal and turns it over on its face, carefully pressing it down onto the tablecloth.\nThe children stare open mouthed. Her husband finally gasps, What are you doing? She smiles at him sadly, shaking her head. You understand nothing. It wasn’t me who did that. The woman who did that, by doing it, no longer exists."

But now that Spicy MacLammermoor, the old king, is dead, I guess I’m it. Maybe I better play a few notes out of this window here, to reassure myself.\nWow! said somebody standing on the sidewalk. Did you hear that?\nI did, said his companion.\nCan you distinguish our great homemade American jazz performers, each from the other?\nUsed to could.\nThen who was that playing?\nSounds like Hokie Mokie to me. Those few but perfectly selected notes have the real epiphanic glow.\nThe what?\nThe real epiphanic glow, such as is obtained only by artists of the caliber of Hokie Mokie, who’s from Pass Christian, Mississippi. He’s the king of jazz, now that Spicy MacLammermoor is gone.\nHokie Mokie put his trombone in its trombone case and went to a gig. At the gig everyone fell back before him, bowing.\nHi Bucky! Hi Zoot! Hi Freddie! Hi George! Hi Thad! Hi Roy! Hi Dexter! Hi Jo! Hi Willie! Hi Greens!\nWhat we gonna play, Hokie? You the king of jazz now, you gotta decide.\nHow ’bout ‘Smoke’?\nWow! everybody said. Did you hear that? Hokie Mokie can just knock a fella out, just the way he pronounces a word. What a intonation on that boy! God Almighty!\nI don’t want to play ‘Smoke,’ somebody said.\nWould you repeat that, stranger?\nI don’t want to play ‘Smoke.’ ‘Smoke’ is dull. I don’t like the changes. I refuse to play ‘Smoke.’\nHe refuses to play ‘Smoke’! But Hokie Mokie is the king of jazz and he says ‘Smoke’!\nMan, you from outa town or something? What do you mean you refuse to play ‘Smoke’? How’d you get on this gig anyhow? Who hired you?\nI am Hideo Yamaguchi, from Tokyo, Japan.\nOh, you’re one of those Japanese cats, eh?\nYes I’m the top trombone man in all of Japan.\nWell you’re welcome here until we hear you play. Tell me, is the Tennessee Tea Room still the top jazz place in Tokyo?\nNo, the top jazz place in Tokyo is the Square Box now.\nThat’s nice. OK, now we gonna play ‘Smoke’ just like Hokie said. You ready, Hokie? OK, give you four for nothin’. One! Two! Three! Four!\nThe two men who had been standing under Hokie’s window had followed him into the club. Now they said:\nGood God!\nYes, that’s Hokie’s famous ‘English sunrise’ way of playing. Playing with lots of rays coming out of it, some red rays, some blue rays, some green rays, some green stemming from a violet center, some olive stemming from a tan center—\nThat young Japanese fellow is pretty good, too.\nYes, he is pretty good. And he holds his horn in a peculiar way. That’s frequently the mark of a superior player.\nBent over like that with his head between his knees—good God, he’s sensational!\nHe’s sensational, Hokie thought. Maybe I ought to kill him.\nBut at that moment somebody came in the door pushing in front of him a four-and-one-half-octave marimba. Yes, it was Fat Man Jones, and he began to play even before he was fully in the door.\nYou mean that sound that sounds like the cutting edge of life? That sounds like polar bears crossing Arctic ice pans? That sounds like a herd of musk ox in full flight? That sounds like male walruses diving to the bottom of the sea? That sounds like fumaroles smoking on the slopes of Mt. Katmai? That sounds like the wild turkey walking through the deep, soft forest? That sounds like beavers chewing trees in an Appalachian marsh? That sounds like an oyster fungus growing on an aspen trunk? That sounds like a mule deer wandering a montane of the Sierra Nevada? That sounds like prairie dogs kissing? That sounds like witchgrass tumbling or a river meandering? That sounds like manatees munching seaweed at Cape Sable? That sounds like coatimundis moving in packs across the face of Arkansas?

Twice a car stopped in front of her on the lake shore, and a young man in uniform got out, brought her the newspapers, and then drove off again; we thought it must be her private chauffeur. The lady was wrapped in several blankets, and we guessed her age to be well over seventy. Sometimes she would wave at a passerby. Probably, we thought, she is one of those rich and respectable Swiss ladies who live on Lake Geneva in the winter while their business is carried on in the rest of the world. The woman was, as we were soon informed, actually one of the richest and most respectable of the Swiss ladies who spend the winter on Lake Geneva; for twenty years she had been a paraplegic and had had her chauffeur drive her almost every day for those twenty years to the shore of Lake Geneva, had always had herself installed on the same bench, and had had the newspapers brought to her. For decades Montreux has owed fifty percent of its tax revenues to her. The famous hypnotist Fourati had hypnotized her twenty years ago and had been unable to bring her out of the hypnosis. In this way Fourati, as is well known, had ruined not only the lady’s life but his own as well."

You were not allowed to turn your head away.\nThe black volumes, their closed faces. They’re like the Algerians who stood at the Friedrichstrasse border crossing, waiting for the Volkspolizei to check their passports. My own passport lay a long time in various glass cubicles. And the fog all over Berlin that day, it is also in this bookcase. An old despair lives in there, it tastes of Passchendaele and the Treaty of Versailles—the taste, in fact, is older than that. The black heavy tomes—I come back to them—they are themselves a sort of passport, and they are so fat because they have accumulated so many stamps through the centuries. There is one trip, apparently, for which your baggage can’t be heavy enough, once you’ve embarked, when finally you . . .\nAll the old historians are there, and are invited to climb up and look into our family. Nothing can be heard, but the lips move all the time behind the glass (Passchendaele. . .). One is reminded of a venerable government office—now follows a true ghost story—a grand building where portraits of longdead men hang behind glass, and one morning there appeared a blur on the inside of the glass. They had begun breathing during the night.\nThe bookcase is even more powerful. Glares straight across the border zone! A shimmering membrane, the shimmering membrane of a dark river in which the room is forced to mirror itself. And you must not turn your head away."

So that nothing unseemly might spoil his feasting, he commanded the royal artisans to design the bull in such a way that its smoke rose in spicy clouds of incense. When the screams of the dying reached the tyrant’s ears, they had the sound of sweet music. And when the bull was reopened, the victims’ bones shone like jewels and were made into bracelets.\nDo you not sometimes wish that certain people might die, do you not long for the deaths of prime ministers or dictators, do you not envision presidents dying of heart attacks, generals shooting themselves while cleaning their rifles, skinflint landlords pushed into wells by rebellious peasants, industrialists skidding on newly waxed floors and sailing through penthouse windows, War Department scientists exposed to radiation while goosing cute researchers in the lab, demagogues exploding with the leaky gas main, your mother-in-law scalded by a pot of boiling chicken soup— do you not wish any or all of these were dead?\nIf the death of one man could bring bliss to the world, would you order that one death? If the deaths of two men could do it, would you order those two deaths? Or five deaths? Or a hundred? Or twenty million? How many deaths would you order to bring bliss to the world?\nIf it required only one man’s death, after all, to bring bliss to the world and you sanctioned such a death, how would you feel should you learn that that one man was to be you?\nDo you think that the most monstrous thing about the story of Phalaris is not that a tyrant put prisoners to death—since that has happened throughout history—but the particularly gruesome way he went about it?\nYet do you never catch yourself wishing that once, only once, once only but definitely once, you could sit beside the tyrant just to satisfy your curiosity about what the bull looked like, what the music sounded like?\nWould you consider Phalaris and his artisans more, or less, reprehensible if the screams of the dying had reached the ear undisguised? If you were one of the victims, would it make any difference to you?\nWhich do you consider the more truly good man: the victim who wishes his screams to be heard as screams, or he who wishes them to be heard as music? Do you think your answer is relevant to the problem of why at executions we praise the victim who meets his death with stoic calm and witty epigrams, rather than he who must be dragged to the scaffold pissing in his pants? In your opinion, is it or is it not a good thing that we do so?\nLearning at this point in the examination that the first victim of the bull was the chief artisan who designed it, do you (a) believe that the artisan deserved his fate?, and (b) feel vaguely uncomfortable about your own occupation, job, profession, or calling? Why or why not?\nBased upon your interpretation of the story of Phalaris and the bull, do you view yourself in the light of your present situation in life as metaphorically equivalent to tyrant, artisan, victim, or wearer of bone jewelry?"

They wore leather jackets and smoked cigars, or at least pretended to, as they flirted with girls and made smart remarks. My brother boasted to me that he’d seen Xavier Cugat, the band leader, at the candy store many times. Cugat was courting Frances Lassman, later known as Abby Lane, who was in my brother’s eighth grade class at P.S. 187. She was beautiful and wasn’t allowed to go out with any of the boys in the neighborhood. According to my brother she was destined for more important things in life—a musical career and marriage to someone successful. Xavier Cugat was then in his thirties, at the height of his fame, and we all knew him from the movies and from photos in newspapers in which he stood in front of his orchestra, his Chihuahua cradled in one hand as he conducted with the other. Or else he’d be alone in the picture, smiling, his pencil-thin mustache curling upwards as he puffed a cigar. Cugat often stopped at the corner to buy himself a cigar. He’d pull up in his black Cadillac, walk briskly into the candy store, and nod to the boys on his way out. Then he’d drive up the hill to Cabrini Boulevard to the six-story apartment house where his future wife Frances lived."

    "text": "A huge cement truck turns the corner, and you get the full impact of its sensuality. Those ruts on the road and in the lawn! Even at night the cement plant has a strange energy, drawing adolescents to stare through its fences, causing the watchman to shine his light nervously among the parked and sleeping mixers. Still, from those fluid beginnings and slow revolutions, the cement itself forms the pale and stony squares of sidewalk. Reassuring. Roller skates, hopscotch, salted ice. Then the slow cracking from the tree roots below and we are back to sensuality again.\nCranes are not to be compared with trees, not with their almost Scandinavian sense of the importance of power and duty. Sometimes the face is very far from the heart, and the one thing you would like to do—lie down next to that beautiful passing stranger, for instance—is the thing that seems least possible. So you sway against the gray sky, pretending to a stiffness you do not feel. The building you helped create rises toward you, filled with the sounds of hammering and the strange shine of work lights.\nTo take some tutoring from pumps, I said. I was thinking about the windmill, that swaying, clanking lecturer. Slow cows come to drink from the tank. We filled it didn’t we, harvesting water from weather, not by bringing it down from the sky like rain, but up from the earth like oil. Now, roll up your blue sleeve and plunge your arm into that tank. If you clench and unclench your fist regularly you can learn something about the submersible pump, beating down there where weather is a dream.\nWe have strong feelings about bulldozers, their buzzing and scraping, their clumsy abruptness, their way of tipping saplings into piles of burnable roots and brush. Our faces get vinegary when we think of it. But the bulldozer’s point of view is remarkably different. The bulldozer thinks of itself as a lover. It considers that its loved one, from whom it is always separated, is wrapped in many short, soft, buttery strips of leather. It imagines itself removing these worn leather wrappings, one at a time and with great tenderness, to get at the body of the loved one. Perverse, you will say. But see, you have already entered the life of the bulldozer: your hands reach for the next piece of leather. Shrubs and young trees go under."

    "title": "A Scholar’s Idea of Happy Endings",
    "text": "The son of a chemist was studying abroad. On his father’s death, he returned home to look after the dispensary, becoming the chemist of a small village on the outskirts of Viadana in the province of Mantua.\nWord of his learning had spread in the country areas, fed by rumours about his huge library, about his prodigious cure for ear-ache, his ultra-modern method for irrigating the fields, and his fluency in twelve languages, not to mention rumours that he was translating the Divine Comedy into German.\nThe owner of a cheese-making factory in the area decided to pay a stipend to the scholar, who was by now middle-aged, in return for which he would help his daughter with her grammar school education. The girl, a sporting type, was not doing too well at school and, furthermore, she hated books, Latin, and good Italian prose. The chemist accepted—more from love of learning than for any financial motive—and every day for a whole summer he went to give lessons to the young athlete.\nAnd one day it happened that the young athlete fell in love with him—so much so that she dropped all sport in favour of writing poetry, Latin verse and, of course, long letters.\nThere are still people who talk of the car the chemist bought to mark the occasion, the couple’s long country trips, and even of nocturnal liaisons in a barn.\nAt any rate, evidence of their late-summer affair only came to light the following winter when a bundle of letters was confiscated by the nuns at the girl’s convent school, and duly handed over to her parents. The contents of these letters seemed so disgusting in the eyes of the owner of the cheese-making factory that he decided to ruin the chemist, and drive him from the village forever.\nThe girl’s brothers, who were active fascists at the time, ransacked his shop on the village square a number of times, and on one occasion gave its owner a savage beating.\nHowever, all this does not seem to have unduly worried the chemist. For a while, he continued to receive customers in the ransacked pharmacy, surrounded by broken window panes, torn down shelves and smashed jars. Then, one fine day, he shut up shop and withdrew among his books, rarely venturing out.\nAll the village knew him to be deep in his studies, and every now and again they saw him smiling as he crossed the square and headed for the post office to pick up new books that had arrived for him.\nSome time later, he was taken to hospital and then to a sanatorium. He remained for a number of years in the sanatorium, and no one heard any more about him.\nOn his return from the sanatorium, the ageing scholar was extremely thin. An old housemaid, who had gone back to taking care of him, complained to everyone that he never wanted to eat: he said he didn’t care to eat, and spent the whole day immersed in his books.\nThinner by the day, the man seldom went out and evidently no longer recognized anyone in the village, including the daughter of the now deceased owner of the cheese-making factory who he occasionally met in the square. Yet he smiled at all and sundry, and it is said he used to greet dogs by raising his hat.\nApparently, he had given up eating altogether after his old housemaid died and persisted in fasting for weeks on end, so that when he was found dead in his library (by a plumber) he was a skeleton in all but name: all that remained of him was wrinkled skin clinging to bones.\nHe was bent over the last page of a book onto which he was sticking a strip of paper.\nYears later, his large library was inherited by a niece. The niece, rummaging through the books, believed she had worked out how the old scholar had spent the last part of his life.\nFor this man, every story, novel, or epic poem had to end happily. He obviously couldn’t bear tragic endings, nor for a story to end on a sad or melancholic note. So, over the years, he devoted himself to re-writing the endings of some hundred or so books in every conceivable language. By inserting small sheets or strips of paper over passages that had to be re-written, he utterly changed the outcome of the stories, bringing them unfailingly to a happy ending.\nMany of the last days of his life must have been dedicated to re-writing the eighth chapter of the third part of Madame Bovary, which is where Emma dies. In the new version, Emma recovers and is reunited with her husband.\nHis very last piece of work, however, consisted of the strip of paper he had in his fingers and which, on the point of dying of starvation, he was sticking onto the last line of a French translation of a Russian novel. This was possibly his masterpiece; by changing just three words, he transformed a tragedy into a satisfactory resolution of life’s problems."

Don’t lie motionless in an attempt to recapture fleeting images; let dreams trickle away, jump out of bed.\nFrom the terrace: watch the Sunrise—with dry eyes, without thinking of the millions, billions of years throughout which this poignant light, and so on and so forth. Nothing of the kind. A bath, soon afterward.\nBreakfast: orange juice, toast, eggs. Eat with appetite, chew vigorously and swiftly; don’t ruminate, don’t mix food with bitter thoughts. Don’t! Coffee. Very strong, with sugar today, just today, never again (from now on, avoid expressions such as never again). Finish off the meal with a glass of ice-cold water, sipping it slowly. Pay special attention to the ice cubes tinkling against the glass. Joyful sound.\nWake up the wife. Make love. And why not? She’s been the companion of so many years. Wife, mother. Make love, yes, a quick act of love, but with the utmost tenderness. Let her go back to sleep afterward. Let her roam through the country of dreams as much as she wants; let her say farewell to her monsters, to her demons, to her fairies, to her princesses, to her godparents.\nGymnastics. Brisk, fierce movements. Afterward, feel the arms tingling, the head throbbing, splitting, almost: life.\nTake the car out of the garage. Drive downtown. Take advantage of the time spent driving to do some thinking. Try to clarify certain doubts once and for all; maybe stop off at the rabbi’s place. Maybe talk to a priest as well. Maybe bring priest and rabbi together?\nAt the office. Render decisions on the latest documents. Tidy up the desk. Clean out the drawers, throw away gewgaws. Set pen to paper. Write a letter, a poem, anything. Write.\nLuncheon. Friends. Salad, cold cuts. Wine. Gab away, talk drivel. Laugh. Observe the faces. Memorize the details of the faces. Hug the friends. Hug them deeply touched. But tearless. No tears at all.\nPhone Dr. Francisco. Ask if there’s anything that can be done (quite unlikely); but say no to tranquilizers.\nReturn home. Get the family together, including the baby of the family. Mention they’ll be taken for a drive, and get the station wagon out of the garage. Head for the outskirts of the city. Find a spot on an elevation with a panoramic view. Park. Have everybody get out of the car. In a low, quiet voice, explain what is about to happen: the earth, which will open up (explain: as if it were parched), the bones, which will appear—the bones only, white, clean—bones that will then be covered with flesh, with hair, with eyes, with finger and toenails: men, women, laughing, crying."

    "text": "Everybody knows the story about me and Dr. Freud, says my grandfather.\nWe were in love with the same pair of black shoes in the window of the same shoe store. The store, unfortunately, was always closed. There’d be a sign: DEATH IN THE FAMILY or BACK AFTER LUNCH, but no matter how long I waited, no one would come to open.\nOnce I caught Dr. Freud there shamelessly admiring the shoes. We glared at each other before going our separate ways, never to meet again.\nIt was the epoch of the masters of levitation. Some evenings we saw solitary men and women floating above the dark tree tops. Could they have been sleeping or thinking? They made no attempt to navigate. The wind nudged them ever so slightly. We were afraid to speak, to breathe. Even the nightbirds were quiet. Later, we’d mention the little book clasped in the hands of the young woman, and the way that old man lost his hat to the cypresses.\nIn the morning there were not even clouds in the sky. We saw a few crows preen themselves at the edge of the road; the shirts raise their empty sleeves on the blind woman’s clothesline.\nMy guardian angel is afraid of the dark. He pretends he’s not, sends me ahead, tells me he’ll be along in a moment. Pretty soon I can’t see a thing. This must be the darkest corner of heaven, someone whispers behind my back. It turns out her guardian angel is missing too. It’s an outrage, I tell her. The dirty little cowards leaving us all alone, she whispers. And of course, for all we know, I might be a hundred years old already, and she just a sleepy little girl with glasses.\nI knew a woman who collected black buttons she found in the street. Some years there’d be only one or two. When I asked her what for and why only black buttons, she shrugged her shoulders. She kept them in a jar on the coffee table. They seduced the eye. One button even had some thread left as if it had been torn in a hurry. A violent scene took place, a burst of passion on some dark doorway, and then she came along the next day and found the button.\nA narrow street with windows weakly lit at dinner time and self-absorbed men and women standing around and an occasional child who eats alone looking at nothing.\nMy aspiration is to create a kind of nongenre made up of fiction, autobiography, the essay, poetry, and of course, the joke!\nA scene from French movies of the fifties that I still love: A fly gets shut in a room with three armed thugs and a woman, gagged and bound, who watches them with eyes popping. In front of each man on the table there is a sugar cube and a pile of large bills. No one stirs. A naked bulb hangs from the ceiling by a long wire so they can see the fly count its legs. It counts them on the table, tantalizingly close to a sugar cube, and then it counts them at the end of someone’s nose.\nI have no idea if this is the way it really was in the movie. I’ve worked on the scene over the years, making little adjustments in it as one does with a poem.\nDescartes, I hear, did his best philosophizing by lazing in bed past noon. Not me! I’m on the way to the dump, tooting my horn and waving to the neighbors."

    "text": "An invasion of beggars, but there’s one consolation: no one lacks shoes, there are more than enough shoes to go around. Sometimes, it’s true, a shoe has to be taken off some severed leg found in the underbrush, and it’s of no use except to somebody with only one good leg. But this doesn’t happen very often, usually corpses are found with both shoes intact. Their clothing on the other hand isn’t usable. Ordinarily it has bullet holes, bloodstains, or is torn apart, or an electric cattle prod has left burns that are ugly and difficult to hide. So we don’t count on the clothes, but the shoes are like new. Generally they’re good, they haven’t had much wear because their owners haven’t been allowed to get very far in life. They poke out their heads, they start thinking (thinking doesn’t wear out shoes), and after just a few steps their career is cut off.\nThat is to say, we find shoes, and since they’re not always the size we need, we’ve set up a little exchange post in a vacant lot downtown. We charge only a few pesos for the service: you can’t ask much from a beggar, but even so it does help to pay for maté and some biscuits. We earn real money only when we manage to have a real sale. Sometimes the families of the dead people, who’ve heard of us heaven knows how, ask us to sell them the dead man’s shoes if we have them. The shoes are the only thing that they can bury, poor things, because naturally the authorities would never let them have the body.\nIt’s too bad that a good pair of shoes drops out of circulation, but we have to live and we can’t refuse to work for a good cause. Ours is a true apostolate and that’s what the police think, too, so they never bother us as we search about in vacant lots, sewer conduits, fallow fields, thickets, and other nooks and crannies where a corpse may be hidden. The police are well aware that, thanks to us, this city can boast of being the one with the bestshod beggars in the world."

    "text": "The eye is the organ of vision, and the third eye is no exception to that. Open it and it sees, close it and it doesn’t.\nMost people have a third eye but they don’t trust it. That wasn’t really F., standing on the corner, hands in his overcoat pockets, waiting for the light to change: F. died two months ago. It’s a trick my eyes played on me, they say. A trick of the light.\nI’ve got nothing against telepathy, said Jane; but the telephone is so much more dependable.\nWhat’s the difference between vision and a vision? The former relates to something it’s assumed you’ve seen, the latter to something it’s assumed you haven’t. Language is not always dependable either.\nIf you want to use the third eye you must close the other two. Then breathe evenly; then wait. This sometimes works; on the other hand, sometimes you merely go to sleep. That sometimes works also.\nWhen you’ve had enough practice you don’t have to bother with these preliminary steps. You find too that what you see depends partly on what you want to look at and partly on how. As I said, the third eye is only an eye.\nThere are some who resent the third eye. They would have it removed, if they could. They feel it as a parasite, squatting in the centre of the forehead, feeding on the brain.\nTo them the third eye shows only the worst scenery: the gassed and scorched corpses at the cave-mouth, the gutted babies, the spoor left by generals, and, closer to home, the hearts gone bubonic with jealousy and greed, glinting through the vests and sweaters of anyone at all. Torment, they say and see. The third eye can be merciless, especially when wounded.\nBut someone has to see these things. They exist. Try not to resist the third eye: it knows what it’s doing. Leave it alone and it will show you that this truth is not the only truth. One day you will wake up and everything, the stones by the driveway, the brick houses, each brick, each leaf of each tree, your own body, will be glowing from within, lit up, so bright you can hardly look. You will reach out in any direction and you will touch the light itself.\nAfter that there are no more instructions because there is no more choice. You see. You see."

Look: there is a hillside cemetery behind us and across the river the plough going in a field and in between, the gated town. Here, an obedient clerk kissing a bishop’s ring, here a frieze of seasonal games, and here the assiduous illuminator himself, bowed to his desk in a corner.\nIn the study hall my hand was cold as a scribe’s in winter. The supervisor rustled past, sibilant, vapouring into his breviary, his welted brogues unexpectedly secular under the soutane. Now I bisected the line AB, now found my foothold in a main verb in Livy. From my dormer after lights out I revised the constellations and in the morning broke the ice on an enamelled waterjug with exhilarated self-regard."

    "text": "In 1944 when I was very young, my family lived in a huge house outside Chongqing, just a stone’s throw from the river that flooded every spring. We had goats, ducks and geese that chased after me, and a vegetable garden. I remember my father gathering giant tomatoes from his garden and juicing them into a large porcelain bowl on the square dining room table. I still remember the glassfuls tasting dank and dark. To this day I still cannot stand its rawness, but drink it camouflaged in a Bloody Mary.\nSince I’ve moved to Idaho and live in my own house, I’ve been raising vegetable gardens in the backyard every season. Among the corn, squash, eggplant, spinach and beet I’ve always saved room for a few tomato plants, even though I never eat them but give them away to friends at harvest time.\nIn the middle of the summer I sometimes walk out of the house and listen to these plants grow, often flicking tiny black aphids from off their stems and leaves. In these moments the tangy odor of their leaves draw childhood recollections of a father dead nineteen years, images of his hands immersed in the white porcelain bowl of tomato juice from his garden, him saying Drink it, drink it, it’s only good for you, it’s vitamin C.\nTonight, at exactly my father’s age in 1944 and nearly five thousand miles and fifty years from my past, I wake to hear the tomato leaves brushing gently against the backdoor of my house in the breeze, and soon after, the fruit bursting like blood in the burgeoning quarter moon."

He rents a cabin from her father, and she walks through the woods—redwood, sword fern, sorrel—to visit him. He speaks to her as an equal and shows her his work. He has begun to sculpt but still paints, relying on color and the memory of line. He also keeps English biscuits in a tin and gives her one each visit. She would like more but he never gives her more. When he undresses her, she sometimes watches him, watches his hands which are thick and square, or his left eye with a small cloud like gray phlegm on the retina. But usually not. Usually she thinks of the path to his house, whether deer had eaten the tops of the fiddleheads, why they don’t eat the peppermint saprophytes sprouting along the creek; or she visualizes the approach to the cabin, its large windows, the fuchsias in front of it where Anna’s hummingbirds always hover with dirty green plumage and jeweled throats. Sometimes she thinks about her dream, the one in which her mother wakes up with no hands. The cabin smells of oil paint, but also of pine. The painter’s touch is sexual and not sexual, as she herself is. From time to time she remembers this interval in the fall and winter of ninth grade. By spring the painter had moved. By summer her period had started. And after that her memory blurred, speeding up. One of her girlfriends French-kissed a boy on a Friday night in the third row from the back at the Tamalpais theater. The other betrayed her and the universe by beginning to hang out with the popular girls whose fathers bought them cars. When the memory of that time came to her, it was touched by strangeness because it formed no pattern with the other events in her life. It lay in her memory like one piece of broken tile, salmon-colored or the deep green of wet leaves, beautiful in itself but unusable in the design she was making. Just the other day she remembered it. Her friends were coming up from the beach with a bucket full of something, smiling and waving to her, shouting something funny she couldn’t make out, and suddenly she was there—the light flooding through the big windows, the litter of canvases, a white half-finished torso on the worktable, the sweet, wheaty odor of biscuits rising from the just-opened tin."

    "text": "When I was little, there were two bakeries in Benfica. One right by the church, frequented by the bagaço-swigging proletariat, the floor was always strewn with sawdust and flattened cigarette butts, and that was called the Adega dos Ossos, where I was advised not to go for fear I might become fatally addicted to cherry brandy and cheap cigarettes and end my days playing dominoes, losing at cards and coughing into my handkerchief. It was a dark place, with lots of bottles on the walls, and in the window were more flies than custard tarts. Beyond the shelves and the spines of the bottles, a library of delirium tremens, I remember the squint-eyed bartender, his right eye furious and his left benevolently tender, and Senhor Manuel, the sacristan, who dropped by in his red surplice between masses and downed a few glasses with eucharistic unctuousness, hiding behind the fridge, afraid he might be spotted by the prior, who was all sternness and buttons from his neck to his shoes, and for whom wine, when not taken with wafers, had the devilish quality of leading the flock astray and causing them to postpone the six o’clock rosary in favor of the abominable vice of cards.\nThe other bakery, the Benfica Paradise, almost opposite the first, was frequented after mass by ladies whose devotion was rustproof, antimagnetic and bulletproof—for example, my grandmothers and my aunts whose intimate knowledge of the saints amazed me and who hastened to teach me the catechism after I asked, pointing my finger at the Holy Spirit\nWhat’s that sparrow doing there?\nexplaining to me that God was not a sparrow, he was a dove, and I immediately imagined him in Praça de Camões eating out of the hands of pensioners, which hardly seemed to me an activity compatible with the creation of the universe.\nParadise was filled by ladies after mass and by men during it.\n(When a cousin of mine indignantly asked her husband why he wasn’t going to church, he replied with a small smug smile\nI don’t need to: I’m in Paradise already. It’s cooler and they serve beer.)\nUnlike the Adega dos Ossos it smelled good, none of the employees had a squint, and dominoes was banned. Senhor Manuel’s surplice did not flutter furtively behind the fridge and, most important of all, my brothers and I had an open account there for cake and ice cream. At first I was so touched by the generosity of that open account I almost wept with gratitude. I realize later that it was not really an act of generosity: it was because on Sundays we had lunch at my grandmother’s house and the gift of ice cream and doughnuts was intended to distract me from the firm posterior of the cook whose charms I had recently discovered. Torn between two equally celestial Paradises, I hesitated for months on end between coconut fancies and the four rings of the stove.\nI finally opted for the stove. When, sometime later, the cook married a policeman\n(all the cooks married policemen)\nand I tried to go back to the doughnuts, my grandmother, disillusioned with my sinful ways, had canceled the account. In desperation, I accompanied her on an excursion for widows to Fátima in an attempt to win back both her affection and the cakes: not even this heroic sacrifice moved her. And I went on to live in a painful state of double orphanhood from which no cheese pastry and no apron has yet shown any interest in rescuing me."

For some reason, we have never gotten around to buying the second set. Apparently it isn’t quite important enough for us to do but is important enough to make us think we ought to buy them at some point. Where’s the salt and pepper? I am heard frequently to ask.\nOh, they’re in the kitchen, my wife answers wearily.\nAt which point our son says, O.K., I know, and goes to get the salt and pepper.\nAnd so we do not remember to buy the second set. If someone were to come up to us on the street and offer to give us a set right there on the spot, we would exclaim, It’s exactly what we need, it’s amazing! But no one does. I went outside a few minutes ago to check. Instead the streets were occupied by very bland people with no interest in giving me some salt and pepper shakers.\nPerhaps our mañana attitude is caused by the satisfying beauty of the ones we do have. They are of the plain old diner variety, glass in vertical facets, with aluminum caps—transparent identical twins, except one is labeled moi and the other tu. We bought them for twenty-nine cents in Arkansas in 1967. They evoke home fries and coffee, and I have no doubt that there is someone who just by looking at them can describe the society that produced them, just as you can read this and know me."

And the bears knew Fydor: his tics, his tenacity, and his peculiar smell—rancid as old fat forgotten at the bottom of a can.\nStill, Fydor was the more cunning. By the roots of windblown trees he dug deep traps and made them secret beneath weavings of bracken and leaves. Many times in the passing of the year would a bear sink with a nauseating thud to be stung by Fydor’s arrows, enfevered with sleep, and hauled off to one of the many stout cages he kept in a cellar called home.\nFydor hated his bears yet could not live without them. Their intimate habits, their torments and hungers excited him, sickened him, obsessed him. He thrived in the stench of their fur, their urine, and their tears.\nAnd in time the bears became obsessed with Fydor. Locked into their cages like flies in amber, they turned to him—for he was the only thing they could turn to. They watched him, memorized his habits: the way he shuffled across the littered floors, or held a pan of water beneath a tap. In time the bears knew Fydor better than a woman knows her man after sharing a half century of boredom and bed. And as alchemists fool with foul matter changing colors and structures, the bears—woolly and immense—entered into Fydor’s dreams, and changed Fydor.\nNight after night they lumbered down the narrow passages of Fydor’s mind to browse its rag stalls, its cut-rate china shops, leaving droppings, making drafts, causing sunset changes. They brought burdens of flowers, of fire; as at a shrine, they drugged the air.\nAnd vines grew inside Fydor’s mind, and halls of green shadow; lean hills, red earth, and places of perpetual picnic. Fydor’s skull—barren before—sprouted grass. His dim, fly-ridden eyes grew luminous. Bears were now coursing through his blood, inhabiting his heart, his liver, his testicles.\nHis nerves writhed bears. His skin crawled bears. His bowels groaned: Bears! His cock yearned: Bears! He ate, slept, dreamed, fucked, and defecated bears until waking in a frenzy of longing, his eyes wild and circling the room like bears on bicycles, he ran to them, his pants bulging with longing and with keys. Fingers trembling, he found the locks and set them free to lumber off into the night.\nAnd Fydor followed them. With a gruff expression of joy half human, half brute, followed his makers into the forest. Another beast among beasts; perhaps less agile, less ferocious perhaps. . . ."

    "text": "I was running to school in fourth grade to get to class before the bell and as I rounded a busy corner I banged into a tall man rushing from the other direction and I was thrown into the air. He weighed so much more than I that I sailed for quite a ways before landing on the sidewalk.\nAre you all right? The man bent over me. His overcoat was a fine camel’s hair, such as I had seen only in the movies. He had on a soft beige scarf and brown woolen gloves and a brown fedora. I’m so sorry, it was my fault completely. Are you all right?\nI nodded, laughing now at the comic spill I had taken, like a cartoon character. How could I explain to him that it had been a pleasure to fly through the air, that there was something even comforting about a collision with such a manly, yet considerate, adult as this stranger.\nI pulled my sticky palms off the sidewalk. The skin was torn up, and bleeding.\nHere, I think I’ve got a Kleenex, he said. He reached into his pocket, felt around, and came up with a monogrammed handkerchief. I stared at the sharp crease in his pants as he crouched alongside me, brushing off the dirt; I was so in love with him that I felt too embarrassed to look at his face. Does that hurt much?\nNo, it doesn’t hurt at all, I lied.\nI just didn’t see you. I was in too big of a hurry, I guess.\nI was also in a hurry.\nThis corner is very tricky. People always seem to have accidents here.\nI wondered how he knew that.\nAs though he could read my mind, he went on to explain: I have a law office nearby, and I see these accident cases all the time.\nSuddenly the words Notary Public popped into my mind. I had read them on golden decals in store windows and wondered often what they meant. Are you a Notary Public? I asked.\nNo, just a lawyer, he laughed gently. My name’s Tony, Tony Bauer (it sounded like). My office is right across Roebling Street, on the second floor. Why don’t you come visit me sometime?\nDo you think you’ll be able to walk now? Maybe we should take you to a drugstore first and get them to put some iodine on your hand.\nI’m all right, I said, letting him help me up. He handed me my blue-and-red bookbag. Only now did I realize I felt dizzy from the blow. Everything was whirling with black outlines in the winter snow. I was going to have another of my headaches.\nWell—goodbye for now. It was a pleasure meeting you, he said, and I felt he really meant it. Too bad it had to come about this way. Then the stranger took off one glove, and was careful not to hurt my bruise in his handshake. I had never seen an adult show a child such tact. As his back turned and he walked away, I had the peculiar urge to yell out, Daddy!\nAfterward I often tried rounding that same corner at full speed, but no one ever banged into me again."

He found himself a dry, mildly fluorescent corner near one of the ribs, and settled down there on some huge organ (it was springy as a waterbed). Everything—the warmth, the darkness, the odor of the sea—stirred in him memories of an earlier comfort. His mother’s womb? Or was it even before that, at the beginning of the circle which death would, perhaps soon, complete? He had known of God’s mercy, but he had never suspected God’s sense of humor. With nothing to do now until the next installment, he leaned back against the rib and let his mind rock back and forth. And often, for hours on end, during which he would lose track of Ninevah and Tarshish, his mission, his plight, himself, resonating through the vault: the strange, gurgling, long-breathed-out, beautiful song."

And the turning on of electricity in ships, portholes of moon, the blue glide of a tug, the harbour road and its ship chandlers, soap makers, ice on bicycles, the hidden anonymous barber shops behind the pink dirt walls of Reclamation Street.\nOne frail memory dragged up out of the past—going to the harbour to say goodbye to a sister or mother, dusk. For years I loved the song, Harbour Lights, and later in my teens danced disgracefully with girls, humming Sea of Heartbreak.\nThere is nothing wise about a harbour, but it is real life. It is as sincere as a Singapore cassette. Infinite waters cohabit with flotsam on this side of the breakwater and the luxury liners and Maldive fishing vessels steam out to erase calm sea. Who was I saying goodbye to? Automatically as I travel on the tug with my brother-in-law, a pilot in the harbour, I sing the lights in the harbour don’t shine for me . . . but I love it here, skimming out into the night anonymous among the lazy commerce, my nieces dancing on the breakwater as they wait, the lovely swallowing of thick night air as it carves around my brain, blunt, cleaning itself with nothing but this anonymity, with the magic words. Harbour. Lost ship. Chandler. Estuary."

    "text": "The first astronaut to reach the Moon proclaimed: One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Neil Armstrong, his head entombed in a white bubble, his eyes obliterated by Moonresilient plastic, gravity-less in a bloated space suit, planted the U.S. flag right where he stood.\nLater, Armstrong realized his mistake. He was supposed to have said: One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\nAs you read this, the Moon is moving away from the Earth. Each year the Moon steals some of Earth’s rotational energy and uses it to propel itself about 3.8 centimeters higher in its orbit.\nHe had never encountered a parasite he didn’t, in some way, envy for a kind of perverse talent.\nThe tidal forces of the Moon—and the Sun—don’t act only on the oceans, they act on the land too. Stand on the equator, and the land beneath you will rise and fall as much as twenty-one inches over the course of twenty-four hours.\nVertigo restrained her from standing near expansive plate-glass windows on the upper floors of top-heavy skyscrapers. She teetered on high heels, the foundation undulating beneath her feet, or maybe she was moonstruck again.\nThe Moon is about the same age as Earth. When the Moon was created, it was much closer to Earth and appeared ten times larger in the sky.\nIn Sunday school, he asked his teacher, Why did God make the Moon without people? His father told him the moon was too cold for people, it was the dark side of God’s work; then his mother broke in, Your father’s being funny. Look at the TV. Michael Jackson, honey, he’s moon-walking.\nThe Moon is full when the Earth is between the Sun and Moon, it is a New Moon when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth.\nNocturnal creatures, cats nightly play and prance, hunting mice, hearing their faint movements behind plaster walls, while their owners beseech moon gods for love and power.\nThe Moon is not a planet, but a satellite of the Earth.\nBeing an identical twin was way cooler than being a virtual one—adopted at the same time, same age, but studies showed virtuals were very different people. He and his brother were unique, even if they looked the same, and he didn’t moon about his lost individuality, the way his twin did.\nAn afterglow—also called post-luminescence—is a wide arc of glowing light that can sometimes be seen high in the western sky at twilight; it is caused by fine particles of dust scattering light in the upper atmosphere.\nShe loved the line, When a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets. She scratched his right arm and nudged him. Naked, you don’t have pockets, he said, unless you’re a fucking kangaroo. Moonlight did nothing for this guy.\nAlan Shepard, when he was on the Moon, hit a golf ball and drove it 2400 feet, nearly half a mile.\nThe moon is made of green cheese, and that crater on it, it’s really a man in the moon. And I haven’t drunk any moonshine.\nAt the full Moon, the times of moonrise and moonset have advanced so that the Moon rises about the same time the Sun sets, and the Moon sets about the same time the sun rises.\nTheir honeymoon, after years of living together, still scared up traditional illusions, intimations of ecstasy, a time out from reality, and when the second night of connubial bliss yawned on, she quoted George Meredith, Where may these lunatics have gone to spend the Moon.\nRamadan begins with the sighting of the new crescent Moon in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. But whose sighting counts?\nShe read the first sentence of the book: A white dog bayed at the Moon, a true moon-dog, with moon-blindness, more blind sometimes than others. The writer must be a lunatic.\nDr. Eugene Shoemaker, a geological surveyor who educated the Apollo mission astronauts about craters, never made it to the Moon . . .. He was rejected as an astronaut because of medical problems. After he died, his ashes were placed on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft on January 6, 1999 . . . and fulfilled Dr. Shoemaker’s last wish.\nOnce in a blue moon, the tides pull at us. They invoke humans to recall primitive ancestors who shouted at the sky, noisemakers who yowled in the dark, beckoning forces and spirits to aid their survival. Now, domesticated dogs guard their masters’ lives, and house cats daydream about orangutans swinging happily from branch to branch. Human beings cannot stop being afraid of the dark or imagining complete freedom."

    "text": "When Mr. and Mrs. Job Sheldon reached Ohio in 1800, with seven children, two oxen, and a bulging wagon, they were greeted by a bone-rattling thunderstorm. The children wailed. Mrs. Sheldon spoke of returning to Connecticut. The oxen pretended to be stone outcroppings, and would budge neither forward nor backward for all of Mr. Sheldon’s thwacking. Lightning toppled so many oaks and elms across the wagon track, in any case, that even a dozen agreeable oxen would have done them no good.\nThey camped. More precisely, they spent the night squatting in mud beneath the wagon, trying to keep dry. Mrs. Sheldon kept saying there had never been any storms even remotely like this one back in Connecticut. Nor any cheap land, her husband added. No land’s cheap if you perish before setting eyes on it, she said. And that ended talk for the night. Every few minutes, Mrs. Sheldon would count the children, touching each head in turn, to make sure none of the seven had vanished in the deluge.\nNext morning it was hard to tell just where the wagon track had been, there were so many trees down. Husband and wife tried cutting their way forward. After chopping up and dragging aside only a few felled trees, and with half the morning gone, they decided Mr. Sheldon should go fetch help from Aurora, their destination. On the land-company map they had carried from the East, Aurora was advertised as a village, with mill and store and clustered cabins. But the actual place turned out to consist of a surveyor’s post, topped by a red streamer. So Mr. Sheldon walked to the next village shown on the map— Hudson—which fortunately did exist, and there he found eight men who agreed to help him clear the road.\nTheir axes flashed for hours in the sunlight before they reached the wagon. The children huddled in shirts while their outer garments dried on nearby bushes. Mrs. Sheldon sat fully dressed and shivering. With the track cleared, the oxen still could not move the wagon through the mud until all nine men and one woman and every child except the toddler and the baby put their shoulders to the wheels. Even though they reached Aurora after nightfall, making out the surveyor’s post in lantern light, the eight ax men insisted on returning immediately to their own homes. The blades glinted on their shoulders as they disappeared from the circle of the campfire.\nDry at last, Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon carried the lantern through this forest that would become their farm. Aurora meant dawn; they knew that. And their family was the dawn of dawn, the first glimmering in this new place. The next settlers did not come for three years."

    "text": "My mother touched the doctor’s hair—Your hair— she said. I was looking at the doctor’s eyes—black and as sad as any eyes I had ever looked at—doleful, mournful—but I thought she is hard-hearted too, this doctor. She must be hard-hearted. Hard-Hearted is part of her job. It has to be.\nThe doctor’s hair was full and long and kinky and wavy and black. My mother’s hair is short and white and kinky and wavy and I could see why my mother was admiring the doctor’s hair. I was admiring the doctor’s body in her jeans. She had what I thought was a girlish and perfect form in her jeans, an enviable form.\nThere were four of us backed up to the large window at the end of the hall, because I had said, Let’s go over to the window to talk—my mother, my sister, and me, and this very young woman doctor with black hair, black eyes, and jeans on.\nWe were at the window at the hospital, at the end of a hall, down from what was left of my father. We were getting the report on my father, because I had said to the doctor, Tell us.\nMaybe the doctor was a little ashamed too, or belligerent, when she was telling us. Her eyes had such a film over them, so that they sparkled when she spoke of his cerebellum, about his brain stem, about the size of his cortical function. She said, He doesn’t know who he is. He does not know who he once was. He does not feel grief or frustration. He does not know who you are. What I was envying then were the doctor’s legs in her jeans. Maybe— I said, you know, maybe—he had such a big brain before—it is just possible, I said, that even if his brain has been ravaged, he is still a smart enough person.\nThe doctor did not say anything about that. No one did.\nChrissy, one of Dad’s day-shift nurses, was coming along then toward us. Her glasses are the kind my sister will not wear. She will not get glasses like that. My mother will not either. A serious person’s glasses—even if Chrissy is only just a nurse, even if she cannot explain very much about the brain, because she explained to me she has been out of school for too long— I can tell she is serious, that she is serious about me too. If she were a man, I would call what we have shared romantic love—we have shared so much, so often here—talking about my father with feeling. If she were a man—even if she couldn’t remember half of what she had learned about the brain—even if she had forgotten it all—no—if she had forgotten it all, totally, I don’t think I’d want to spend the time of day in her presence. She would disgust me if she were a man like that. So when she called us, when she said, Your father— and then when I called Dad! Dad! from the—and it sounded even to me as if I expected he would rise up—then I was ready for what I was feeling when I touched his forehead—which was still warm. His mouth was open. The front of the lower row of his teeth was showing. The teeth had never looked, each of them, so terribly small. Some of his teeth were the last things on my father that I ever touched."

We’ll bury Jess later, when the river recedes, before the ground turns hard again.\nShot by a monkey, Elsa leaned against the banyan, held a bandage to the wound. They’d entered camp just before dawn, made off with a pistol, some candy bars, and a Desmond Morris book. We counted as six shots rang out, one of them finding poor Elsa’s arm. Relieved that the simian was out of ammunition, we packed up. On the way out of camp we noticed a monkey on the riverbank, hammering at a snake with the gun."

At first, with our wives gone, our spirits rose and we all thought the sound was beautiful. But then we ceased to be aware of it, grew uneasy, and quarreled more often among ourselves.\nThat was during the year of high winds. Never before had such tumult raged in our village. Sparrows could not fly, but swerved and dropped into calm corners; clay tiles tumbled from the roofs and shattered on the pavement. Shrubbery whipped our low windows. Night after night we drank insanely and fell asleep in one another’s arms.\nWhen spring came, the winds died down and the sun was bright. At evening, long shadows fell across our floors, and only the glint of a knife blade could survive the darkness. And the darkness fell across our spirits, too. We no longer had a kind word for anyone. We went to our fields grudgingly. Silently we stared at the strangers who came to see our fountain and our church: we leaned against the lip of the fountain, our boots crossed, our maimed dogs shying away from us.\nThen the road fell into disrepair. No strangers came. Even the traveling priest no longer dared enter the village, though the sun blazed in the water of the fountain, the valley far below was white with flowering fruit and nut trees, and the heat seeped into the pink stones of the church at noon and ebbed out at dusk. Cats paced silently over the beaten dirt, from doorway to doorway. Birds sang in the woods behind us. We waited in vain for visitors, hunger gnawing at our stomachs.\nAt last, somewhere deep in the heart of the cedar trees, our wives stirred and thought of us. And lazily, it seemed to us, carelessly, returned home. We looked on their mean lips, their hard eyes, and our hearts melted. We drank in the sound of their harsh voices like men coming out of the desert."

Even the crooked nails are going in straight. The handsaw glides through grease. The toenailed stubs hold. The deck has risen up around me, and now it’s strong enough to support my weight, to not sway with this old, silly, wrong-footed dance I’m about to throw my whole body into.\nPlumbed from sky to ground, this morning’s work can take nearly anything!

I slept fitfully, awakened by fears or loud neighbors, and decided to stay awake, but only because I had homework to do and now was as good a time as any to do it. A commotion outside caused me to go to the window but only for a few minutes. I opened the window and stuck my head out but only to see whether a revolution had commenced. I could see the eyes of the people in the street below, but only a few of them looked familiar. The people were looking up, but only because of a strong light flashing from the top of the building.

Stop coughing, Dad says. You’ll wake the dead. Bat flap and smoke in the dark of his voice make me hold back this need, hold back from Dad, whose fleshy skull clenches every raw cough I cough. I want to be still. I fix on the chafed, pitted folds at his neck with a promise to sleep, as if my quiet could ease and uncoil this turned-away man, but I can’t and it’s out, rude air through the pipes, a dry sound full of rust. Dad says, I’m too old for this. He says, Oblige me, and I watch the words turn in this room he calls his own, Dad’s porch, sleeping headquarters, off-limits. How did I get here, close enough to smell him? That’s what I want to know: How did I?\nRolled, damp toweling—the kind Dad sometimes swipes at me—he smells like that. He smells like shaving water, where he floats his brush and lets me blow apart the suds before he snaps a towel, says, Out. That’s enough; go get dressed. I only pretend to leave. He never shuts the door all the way, and I want to see, and I can, if I am careful, if I am clever. From where I am hiding, just outside the bathroom door, I can see him. I can see him oiling his back under the sunlamp. It makes me feel lazy just watching him: the way my father massages himself and rolls his shoulders in this heat. So much heat, so much white in wild refraction off the swivel mirror; I see he has to squint to see the parts of himself in the magnified side, where the black eye, lashless and fast, his eye, finds me.I hold to the edge of my bed and watch him sleep.

Baudelaire, I am no one but the insatiable identities that descend upon me and tonight it is you. I’ve thought, if Baudelaire were not Baudelaire, I would be Baudelaire, though in truth I have thought the same about Walter Benjamin when he says (I paraphrase), I am in love with Baudelaire because of his interest in furniture. When writing about furniture Baudelaire is free from capitalism’s philosophy and history and archaeology and is enthralled by upholstery, and this is a way of thinking and being that is wholly new in the world and was made so by Baudelaire.\nNo quotation is innocent. Every quotation is an act of ventriloquism. Every ventriloquism is an usurpation. As R. P. Blackmur said (and here I do not quote but paraphrase): If you say there is no blackbird in a poem immediately a blackbird alights on the branch of a line. If you say, I am only quoting, immediately your voice guiltily alights on the branches of the words.\nIn Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism, as Walter Benjamin carries forward the great cross of his love for you, as he is nailing himself to his love for you, at the height of his passion, he stops on page seventy-one to quote that gnat Maxime Du Camp:\nBaudelaire had what is a great defect in a writer, a defect of which he was not aware: he was ignorant. . .. He remained unacquainted with history, physiology, archeology and philosophy. . .. He had little interest in the outside world; he may have been aware of it, but he certainly did not study it.\nAnd in doing so, at the height of his love, Walter Benjamin enters and is entered, he becomes Maxime Du Camp. Baudelaire knew nothing, says (sneers) Benjamin. Why, I have always wondered, does he do that?\nCher Baudelaire, I believe that behind or inside Benjamin’s quotation from Maxime Du Camp, growing upon it as a vine grows on a trellis, there lives the envy and sorrow of a man cut off from the possibility of another’s experience. There lives the envy of a man who knew history for another man who did not; there lives the love of a man (Benjamin) who loved philosophy for a man (you) who did not love it and by extension would not have loved him (Benjamin) or perhaps could not love him. Would you have wasted an afternoon on Benjamin? No. Is there even one syllable in you to suggest that you care at all about Benjamin? No. Which must have hurt.\nI, on the other hand, am perfectly aware that you adore me because we adore so many of the same things—furniture, women’s dresses, recreational drugs. In every line and flourish I hear you calling out to me as I sit here in the furnishings of the future; I see you waving to me in the windows of my train of thought as though you were waving to yourself at some time in the future; as though I were you with my poems filled with dresses and drugs and unfaithful women, some of whom are me. How grateful you are that I have resurrected you, that you can live in the present with all its wonderful appurtenances, with its fantastic advances in perfumes, the advent of hair gel, the Alps of the four-inch stiletto. How lucky you are, cher Baudelaire, to have found me to shelter you, to have found the succulent hallways of my lines, and the shimmering windows of my tropes, and the sticky navels of the little hash pipes I have left lying about for you, the ease, the comfort, the respite my verse provides you. Or maybe not. I sit on my train and watch capitalism struggle in the windows. In the city of the mind the great alcove of night closes over us. Even over you, Baudelaire, who invented a world that had never before existed—a completely interior world of upholstery without philosophy— and in so doing gained the undying envy of the future Walter Benjamin, who was sentenced to live inside a world outside and who, therefore, had to save himself from that world and its history by committing suicide at Hotel de Francia in Port-Bou in September of 1940."

Will they bear their mother’s name? I suppose you have forgotten that my birthday falls on Monday after next? Will you come to visit me in hospital?; I stood up, I sat down, I stood up again; the clock slowed down, the post came late, the afternoon turned cool; the cat licked his coat, tore the chair to shreds, slept in a drawer that didn’t close; I entered a room, I felt my skin shiver, then dissolve, I lighted a candle, I saw something move, I recognized the shadow to be my own hand, I felt myself to be one thing; the wind was hard, the house swayed, the angiosperms prospered, the mammal-like reptiles vanished (Is the Heaven to be above? Is the Hell below? Does the Lamb still lie meek? Does the Lion roar? Will the streams all run clear? Will we kiss each other deeply later?); in the peninsula some ancient ships are still anchored, in the field the ox stands still, in the village the leopard stalks its prey; the buildings are to be tall, the structures are to be sound, the stairs are to be winding, in the rooms sometimes there is to be a glow; the hats remain on the hat stand, the coats hang dead from the pegs, the hyacinths look as if they will bloom—I know their fragrance will be overpowering; the earth spins on its axis, the axis is imaginary, the valleys correspond to the mountains, the mountains correspond to the sea, the sea corresponds to the dry land, the dry land corresponds to the snake whose limbs are now reduced; I saw a man, He was in a shroud, I sat in a rowboat, He whistled sweetly to me, I narrowed my eyes, He beckoned to me, Come now; I turned and rowed away, as if I didn’t know what I was doing."

This morning you put on the coffee water, she sighs, and she heads out to the shower.\nOf course this simple request is quite beyond me, because of my size and because of my simple-minded digital capabilities.

I sit in my chair, feeling absurdly small and puny in it, with a bit of tail hanging down back. I have nothing to eat, so I fall to licking my paws. For God’s sake, can’t you stop biting your damn nails? my girlfriend murmurs.\nI stop and stare at her. Something in me snaps. You unfeeling brute! I screech at her, all my woebegoneness flooding into rage. Here I’ve been turned into some kind of rodent right under your nose—and you haven’t even noticed!\nShe stares back, dumbfounded. Her mouth is open. Then her eyes flash. She slams down her coffee mug so that it slops all over the table. Look who’s talking! she bellows. She grabs handfuls of her large, loose ears.

There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man’s legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground."

    "title": "The Sleepless Night of Eugene Delacroix",
    "text": "In North Africa, Delacroix had seen a Jewish wedding which he described extensively in his journal:\nShe is silhouetted halfway against the door, halfway against the wall; nearer the foreground, an older woman, with a great deal of white, which conceals her almost entirely, the shadows full of reflections; white in the shadows.\nNine years later, in the Salon of 1841, he exhibited a painting entitled, Jewish Wedding.\nAfter the wedding, the congratulations, the eating, drinking, and dancing, the bride and bridegroom walked out into the night; her white dress turned blue; it grew smaller; finally a speck of dust was blinked away.\nOn March 11, 1854, Eugene Delacroix sat down at his favorite desk (a gift—actually one of many he had received from a Pasha in Tangiers) and wrote in his journal:\nA long interruption in these poor notes of daily happenings: I feel very badly about it; these trifling pages written down in such a fugitive way seem to me all that is left of my life, the more it flows away. My lack of memory makes them necessary for me; since the beginning of the year, the steady work needed for finishing at the Hôtel de Ville has been distracting me too much; since I finished it, and that will soon be a month since, my eyes are in a bad state, I am afraid to read and to write.\nHe felt as he put down the pen and straightened his back that the rest of his evenings, his nights and days, would be filled with a new kind of darkness. At first he thought he could turn to his friends. But Mme Sand was on her way to Vienna, and Chopin had not received him twice in the last week. Most likely, he was in the throes of composition.\nDelacroix felt his fears being heightened by the underlying silence of day becoming night. He wished he were sitting in the green brocade chair in Frederic’s apartment, listening to him playing the piano. The evening’s shadows, both inside and outside, were beginning to overlap, while he remained seated at his desk, his chin cupped between his hands, his eyes closed.\nHe remembered that twenty years ago M. Gros had told him that he had once lived a life devoted to excess. But now he, M. Gros, drank nothing but water with dinner. In fact, being deprived of a cigar after dinner was the greatest hardship of all the ones he had to face. Delacroix wondered what he had forgotten about that evening. What moments would never be retrieved?\nIt was well past midnight, yet restlessness permeated his movements. The moon slit the thick velvet drapes, but it couldn’t reach him. Instead, on either side of his bed two strips of light wavered along the carpet. Outside, someone remarked on the sultry beauty of the night in a high silly voice. I am afraid to read and to write.\nThe lamp continued flickering; three dull concentric circles peered back from the ceiling. Delacroix rolled over on his side; he faced the night table, as he had done many times in the last few hours. Except for the table, everything had become a shadow; the chair in the corner was a blotch of darkness. He turned back to the table. A pile of books lay there, precariously balanced. They were a staircase rising in memory of the house that no longer surrounds them."

It was my first sea voyage.\nUntil then I had lived on solid land, on the Indian subcontinent and all my journeys had been by train or car or on small wooden boats on the canals and waterways of the coastal region I come from.\nThe sea cast me loose.\nThe sea tore away from me all that I had. In doing so, it gave me an interior life far sooner than I would have had otherwise, but at great cost.\nI was forced to enter another life, the life of the imagination.\nBut it was not as yet the life of language.\nI had few words at my disposal, and those I had came from several languages that cohabited within my head. What I felt as a child and held deep within myself quite exceeded the store of words within my reach.\nThis is something that I feel, even now as an adult. The struggle for words, the struggle to be human, is coexistent for me with the craft of poetry.\nOn my fifth birthday I was plunged into a world with no before and no after.\nA child can fall into the sea, never to reappear.\nA mother can appear out of the waves, only to vanish, reappear, and then vanish again.\nThe sea has no custom, no ceremony. It allows a theater for poetry, for a voice that cries out, that splits into one, two, three or more, chanting the figurations of the soul, marking a migrant memory.\nThe day I turned five, I stuck my head out through the porthole of our cabin and saw ceaseless water. On and on, until my eyes and neck hurt, I kept watch.\nWhen I pulled my head back in I knew the sea was painted on the inside of my eyelids, would never leave me.\nSometimes the syllables of poetry well up, waves on the surface of the sea, and they burst as flying fish might, struck by light.\nSometimes I feel this is how I began, a wordless poet, a child on the surface of wide water with all that she loved torn from her, cast into ceaseless suspension.\nThe page on which I write is a live restless thing, soul-sister to the unselving sea."

    "text": "Nearly everyone had left that bar in the middle of winter except the hardcore. It was the coldest night of the year, every place shut down, but not us. Of course we noticed when she came in. We were Indian ruins. She was the end of beauty. No one knew her, the stranger whose tribe we recognized, her family related to deer, if that’s who she was, a people accustomed to hearing songs in pine trees, and making them hearts.\nThe woman inside the woman who was to dance naked in the bar of misfits blew deer magic. Henry Jack, who could not survive a sober day, thought she was Buffalo Calf Woman come back, passed out, his head by the toilet. All night he dreamed a dream he could not say. The next day he borrowed money, went home, and sent back the money I lent. Now that’s a miracle. Some people see vision in a burned tortilla, some in the face of a woman.\nThis is the bar of broken survivors, the club of shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture. We who were taught not to stare drank our beer. The players gossiped down their cues. Someone put a quarter in the jukebox to relive despair. Richard’s wife dove to kill her. We had to hold her back, empty her pockets of knives and diaper pins, buy her two beers to keep her still, while Richard secretly bought the beauty a drink.\nHow do I say it? In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses. I could say it in my own and the sacred mounds would come into focus, but I couldn’t take it in this dingy envelope. So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense.\nMy brother-in-law hung out with white people, went to law school with a perfect record, quit. Says you can keep your laws, your words. And practiced law on the street with his hands. He jimmied to the proverbial dream girl, the face of the moon, while the players racked a new game. He bragged to us, he told her magic words and that’s when she broke, became human.\nBut we all heard his bar voice crack:\nWhat’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?\nThat’s what I’d like to know, what are we all doing in a place like this?\nYou would know she could hear only what she wanted to; don’t we all? Left the drink of betrayal Richard bought her, at the bar. What was she on? We all wanted some. Put a quarter in the juke. We all take risks stepping into thin air. Our ceremonies didn’t predict this. Or we expected more.\nI had to tell you this, for the baby inside the girl sealed up with a lick of hope and swimming into praise of nations. This is not a rooming house, but a dream of winter falls and the deer who portrayed the relatives of strangers. The way back is deer breath on icy windows.\nThe next dance none of us predicted. She borrowed a chair for the stairway to heaven and stood on a table of names. And danced in the room of children without shoes.\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.\nWith four hungry children and a crop in the field.\nAnd then she took off her clothes. She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we’d all become.\nShe was the myth slipped down through dreamtime. The promise of feast we all knew was coming. The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us. She was no slouch, and neither were we, watching.\nThe music ended. And so does the story. I wasn’t there. But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left."

This was the story he told, of all the farm-boy stories he might have told; he chose the one where brutality saves a life. He wanted me to feel, when he fitted his body over mine, that this was how I would go on—this was how I would be known."

That was the signal to transport myself to the big top, imagining the ringmaster’s introduction: Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the United States and Canada, here she is, Trixie, the tiger woman. I never divulged my hobby to him. Colette of the talking poodles, Chloe, the human fly, and Rosa, the rubber lady, were foreign to him as relaxing with a good circus novel.\nAfter another exasperating weekend of key-hunting, I drifted into an uneasy sleep. I dreamed that my husband and I were an acrobatic team. He was tall and worldly in military blue and a red shirt, designed to reveal his biceps, bulging like two loaves of bread. I wore a silver tutu, accentuating my small waist and large breasts. Our act was complex, and far surpassed any that I’d seen on television or read about in histories of the Flying Capezios. Like a shooting star, I’d hurl myself from the trapeze to be caught by my husband, who held a solid gold key between his teeth. People below gasped at his dental fortitude. Although the act was perilous and required the concentration of a bibliographer transcribing into braille, we’d smile at one another like fifteen-year-olds over a coke.\nI woke up feeling transformed. The next Saturday my husband was startled to find me dressed before him for our weekly tour of curio shops, garbage dumps, and demolished buildings. He supposed my enthusiasm was the result of reading some gushy article about togetherness in a woman’s magazine or that my doctor had prescribed a hobby to cure my frequent headaches. Little does he know that I practice every day. Shades drawn, I hang from the crystal chandelier and propel myself across the room, landing lightly as a moth on a coat lapel."

    "title": "El Bandido",
    "text": "El bandido was a stereotype but he prospered in the history books and got away with riches, women, and many killings. El bandido wore the typical large sombrero, bandoliers loaded with bullets, and a huge handlebar moustache. He rode into battle on horses with his men, his victories accumulating as the masses revolted throughout the country. When he held court around huge campfires, his men huddled close and listened to every word. When his enemies were lined up against adobe walls to be shot, his men relished the opportunity to be in one of the firing squads. El bandido had a large belly and a round face, prominent features in hundreds of antique photographs of the war. His cruelty against his enemies and his love of women were legendary. His horse was a prize stallion and his soldiers were always well armed. El bandido’s hacienda was heavily guarded and the dining table was stacked with food, liquor, and boxes of the best cigars. Though he had many wives and mistresses, he slept alone on most nights, moving from one large bedroom to another in the enormous houses on his estate. When he slept, he had a recurring dream where he found himself in wet caverns where the many faces of the men he had personally shot stared at him through the dripping water. When he couldn’t sleep, he lay awake in the dark and pondered the next campaign. Each morning he sat on the edge of his bed and stared briefly at the old wooden crucifix on the far wall before leaving. El bandido rode at the head of a long column of men and horses, the cause refreshed each time the dream of the caverns came to him. Battles were lost and won, but he accumulated more power and riches as the number of dead men who had followed him rose into the thousands. When a foreign army entered the country and chased him for over four months, el bandido’s fame intensified and the stereotype grew. The few battles the two sides engaged in were minor, though more men died and more photographers took pictures. When the invading troops gave up on catching him, he sat on his horse atop a desert ridge and watched the distant dust clouds of the retreating army. As the sun began to set, el bandido waited on the ridge with three of his most trusted generals. No one spoke because he didn’t say a word. Several more years of fighting followed as towns were captured and lost and the country suffered over 200,000 dead. El bandido had three ranches near the end of the struggle and had survived two assassination attempts. The new government offered to pardon him, though his army was the largest at the end of the revolution. El bandido refused to be pardoned, though he promised not to march on the capitol and he let his men go home. The few dozen that stayed to work on his ranches were younger stereotypes of the legend. Their ambitions, guns, and women were abundant and their dreams were influenced by their loyalty to their leader. Three years after the revolt, el bandido was the richest man in the northern part of the country and he married his sixth wife. A few nights after the wedding, el bandido woke alone. The recurring dream did not visit him as often as it used to, so he lay calmly in the large bed until he heard his wife crying somewhere. Out of habit, he reached for his pistol and stepped quietly toward the next room. As he opened the door, he found his wife tied to a chair, six of his ranch hands surrounding her with drawn guns, one of them holding a pistol to the woman’s head. El bandido and his men exchanged volleys in the truest stereotype of a western gunfight. He killed four of them before the other two put nine bullets into him and two in his wife. The two men ran out to the dozens of waiting and mounted riders whose bandoliers, rifles, and faces glistened in the summer moonlight."

One day, waving at a stream—the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches—I let a glove go. Into the stream, sucked under the street. Since when did streets have mouths? I walked home on a desperate road. Gloves cost money. We didn’t have much. I would tell no one. I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket. I knew my mother’s eyes had tears they had not cried yet, I didn’t want to be the one to make them flow. It was the prayer I spoke secretly, folding socks, lining up donkeys in windowsills. To be good, a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night. If you don’t get in my bed, I will be good. And they listened. I had a lot to fulfill.\nThe months rolled down like towels out of a machine. I sang and drew and fattened the cat. Don’t scream, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t fight—you could hear it anywhere. A pebble could show you how to be smooth, tell the truth. A field could show how to sleep without walls. A stream could remember how to drift and change—next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he’d only hurry up with the bread, when I saw it. The yellow glove draped on a twig. A muddy survivor. A quiet flag.\nWhere had it been in the three gone months? I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know. There were miracles on Harvey Street. Children walked home in yellow light. Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far, but returned. A thousand miles later, what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos?\nPart of the difference between floating and going down."

    "text": "We went to the movies every Friday and Sunday. On Friday nights the Colonial filled with an oily fragrance of teenagers while we hid in the back row of the balcony. An aura of light from the projection booth curved across our shoulders, round under cotton sweaters. Sacred grunts rose in black corners. The screen was far away and spilling color—big men sweating on their horses and women with powdered breasts floating under satin. Near the end the film smelled hot and twisted as boys shuddered and girls sank down in their seats. We ran to the lobby before the lights came up to stand by the big ash can and watch them walk slowly downstairs. Mouths swollen and ripe, they drifted down like a sigh of steam. The boys held their arms tense and shuffled from one foot to the other while the girls sniffed and combed their hair in the big mirror. Outside the neon lights on Main Street flashed stripes across asphalt in the rain. They tossed their heads and shivered like ponies.\nOn Sunday afternoons the theater was deserted, a church that smelled of something frying. Mrs. Causton stood at the door to tear tickets with her fat buttered fingers. During the movie she stood watching the traffic light change in the empty street, pushing her glasses up over her nose and squeezing a damp Kleenex. Mr. Penny was her skinny yellow father. He stood by the office door with his big push broom, smoking cigarettes and coughing.\nWalking down the slanted floor to our seats we heard the swish of her thighs behind the candy counter and our shoes sliding on the worn carpet. The heavy velvet curtain moved its folds. We waited, and a cavernous dark pressed close around us, its breath pulling at our faces.\nAfter the last blast of sound it was Sunday afternoon, and Mr. Penny stood jingling his keys by the office door while we asked to use the phone. Before he turned the key he bent over and pulled us close with his bony arms. Stained fingers kneading our chests, he wrapped us in old tobacco and called us his little girls. I felt his wrinkled heart wheeze like a dog on a leash. Sweethearts, he whispered."

    "text": "Henrik Ibsen never went anywhere without his hat. Refusing to entrust it to a hatcheck’s charge, he preferred to place it beside him, always requisitioning an empty seat at whatever cost. Its positioning was crucial and the dramatist took great pains to tilt it just right. The significance of the hat, a mystery heretofore, was only recently revealed when a packet of the playwright’s letters were sold at Sotheby’s. I spotted you this afternoon in the crook of my hat, he addressed a correspondent by the initial N (thought by some to have inspired Nora). Apparently flattered by the famous man’s attention, N must have challenged him to explain. For another note dated the following day reads: Man must protect himself from beauty’s Medusa gaze. Do tell me where you plan to sit at tomorrow’s performance. I prefer pearl earrings. And yet another note concludes: The cad, the fool, the critic T rushing to congratulate me for yesterday’s premiere of P.G. (probably Peer Gynt) knocked over my doffer and smashed my second set of eyes. Will have to love you blindly ‘til I find a replacement. Ibsen, it seems, wore a pocket mirror tucked into the sweatband of his hat—which explains an obscure line crossed out in the original manuscript of A Doll’s House: Only enclosed by glass does beauty arouse manageable emotions."

And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes. Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus was the broom of the kidneys. I hadn’t understood at first and thought she’d used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how she’d giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she had single-handedly decimated her husband’s glass collection dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do. We saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then became memory. With unparalleled patience I jumped through hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with unparalleled dexterity. I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her elbow. My heart. But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability to dissemble. Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor, and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity, time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on amphetamines. Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to the angry god of its vortex. Your voice is like acid on my skin, she said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me behind like so much history."

    "text": "Every night women in love gather outside the window and it is nothing special; coming out is what stars do, clouds, the sun when it builds up the nerve and then has to just blurt out. Their thoughts collect there, outside, the window of no value to them unless they marvel at coincidence; the window is just how I know it happens. I am not part of the circle although every game I played as a girl was round. By morning there is fruit on branches not meant to bear witness anymore, that birds avoid and that embarrasses me so I don’t taste it; I don’t find out if they’re edible berries, and even if they were, I’d let them shrink and drop dried; I can’t see myself snatching berries, especially not from a shrub so brambled, the branches look as if the feet of little birds tangled and broke off to appease beaks that had to get into those berries no matter what. This is the wrong thing to say because someone will start thinking that women in love set traps, bait bushes, trick birds, act out fables in which birds are made to always fly, to exhaust their wings, to be up soaring to death because they can’t resort to landing. This is how the great hoverers are made. But women in love can do more than this, making is too traditionally and industrially valued to be a special accomplishment, a reason to gather when light isn’t that good and there are no decent shadows, and the lit square and rectangular windows are irregular stars so big in their closeness they can’t be wished on and personalized; stars are better the more distant they are so that to wish on them is to empower pinpricks. My eyes do not close without seeing what darkness holds, the letdown hair of women and welcome. And I remember where I was when I was fertilized, where as zygote I was stamped with most destinies but Eagle Scout, where I was when I divided and doubled without taking up additional space for a long time, before testing the limits of the skin that did not fail and being delivered; with a woman, deep inside a woman, expanding a woman’s body from the inside, depending on a woman, filling a woman. This is what I remember while I’m saying that other prayer and singing that song I took, as a girl, as jingle: all day, all night, the angels watching over me. Outside my window. In honor of them for forty years I bleed libation."

The exertion involved was minimal—in truth, I welcomed it—but I screamed bloody murder every time.\nI think I already know what comes next: a stipulative definition of marriage as an accidental adjacency of flesh in which small, unbegrudged exchanges of affection are fitfully possible provided that . . . and then you get so many pages of provided thats. The pages are wrinkled-looking, as if somebody had read them in the bathtub and then set them out on the floor to dry.

    "title": "Contributor’s Note",
    "text": "Michael Martone was born at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1955. It is interesting to note that the attending physician was a Doctor Frank Burns, Major, United States Army, retired, and recently returned to Fort Wayne following service in the police action in Korea. It was the same Dr. Burns, it turned out, who years later served as the model for the character Frank Burns appearing in the novel M*A*S*H authored by Richard Hooker, and in the movie and television versions based on the book. Martone recalls the modest premiere of the Altman film in 1970 and its initial screening at the Embassy Theater in downtown Fort Wayne. Dr. Burns, who had continued, after Martone’s birth (it had been a difficult one, sunny-side up, where forceps were used), to be his mother’s gynecologist, arrived at the theater, the guest of honor, in a 1959 Cadillac Seville provided by Means Motor Company on Main Street. Sally Kellerman and Jo Ann Pflug also were there. All during the run of the television series, Dr. Burns, now in semiretirement, happily appeared at strip-mall ribbon cuttings and restaurant openings, a kind of official goodwill ambassador, and took the ribbing from the public whose perception of his character had been derived from what they had read or seen in the movies and on television. His son, Frank Jr., was two years ahead of Martone at North Side High School. Frank Jr. anchored the 4x440 relay for the Redskin varsity track and field club, where Martone served as team manager. Martone remembers Dr. Burns, team physician, coaching him in the use of analgesic balm and the scrubbing of cinders out from beneath the skin after a runner fell on the track. It was Dr. Burns who, later, diagnosed Martone’s mother’s ovarian cancer in 1979 and performed the failed hysterectomy that led to his mother’s death that summer. It was Dr. Burns, still in surgical scrubs, who met the family in the waiting room of St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, the same hospital where Martone, twenty-four years before, had been born, delivered, by means of forceps, by Dr. Burns. The television was on, of course, an RCA model made in Bloomington, Indiana, and Martone remembers how hard it was not to watch it while, in a strange way, he also felt that he was watching himself listening to Dr. Burns rehearse the final few minutes of his, Martone’s, mother’s life."

They are from my manuscript, X = Pawn Capture, a lyrical study of chess as we played it in my family: the first move has to take place while everyone is thinking about something other than chess. For my grandparents, diversion was love, and between his ragefilled checkmates and her play dates with saints, they braided my teenage years spent mostly schooling and listening and keeping the house free of insects.\nWhen in our backyard caterpillars mastered the flowering dogwoods, and our neighbor dispersed them by rapping on the trees with a stick, her image reminded my grandmother of Hortense tormenting Germana Cousin for her presumed pilfering of a small loaf of bread. Germana opens her dress and her saintliness is revealed as summer flowers tumble out in a herald of love and beauty. Here my grandmother saw chastisement and the Holy Hand of her Invisible Lord Partitioning The Mortals with some tiny visuals about The Power and The Glory but I thought if so He was really Just Sprinkling the World with His Blossoms and Berries, and if Germana’s cottons could give way to an onrush of flesh, abandoning its pinks and greens and holy stamens and anthers and spilt maple leaves and maybe even ruffles of filaments and pollen, might it ever be under my opened dress, this mound of petals, with my thin body lighter than bone from what I knew? So when I looked up and the neighbor was walking away over broken dogwood blossoms snowing down, I wished hard for a language that would tell you of this beautiful sight which I have never before seen, not even on a holy card, and this in spite of my grandmother’s hissing at our neighbor and retrieving a rake. I spent the afternoon carrying away the remainders of Germana’s undressing and tried to find a dictionary I could bring to my room. Because beautiful is a word that my workshop class says is ineffective, that it doesn’t contain how this sight captures my attention and convinces me, absorbs and converts me away from the yard, so that the closest kin might be diverting, which the class might find archaic, and if that’s true, then I don’t know how to say that everything in the backyard might be pretending to be lovely in order that we can all get up in the morning."

The city was full of people, and forgetting caution, she’d go wherever invited back then, even out to Brooklyn or to Queens. The factory was its own community, a motley group of natives and new arrivals, desperate or hopeful. Married or not, everyone, it seemed, found a lover there. But those who lacked the efficacy of English toiled all day, mute as machines. What became of them? Some escaped her. Others, who were long since hidden, come forward now, pushed by memory’s levers. All left an imprint. The German immigrants, I’ll never forget them: Casamia, the gypsy, and Crazy Judy, nervous, saluting the boss with their number tattoos.

It yields enough to sustain us, after all, the ocean of the past. We’ve paid.

Understandably, these days, my grandmother can’t just sit around waiting for the next war. Frantically, she hoards the ingredients for stuffed duck in her cellar—her deep freezer is full of headless bodies in plastic wrap, and she’s bought an oil generator because it’s common knowledge that electricity is one of the first things to go in wartime; the oil should last for a few Sunday dinners at least. On Sundays, my grandmother calls up her grandchildren, one by one: Will you come when the war starts? she asks. Will you come? We explain that there could be complications, there could be roadblocks, there could be shooting, someone might even be drafted. I’m not eating my duck by myself, grandmother sobs into the receiver, not all by myself, dinners like that make no sense. I hate war, I hate wars like this, wars used to be comme il faut in the old days, they didn’t interfere with my stuffed duck. Those days are over, Grandma, we explain patiently, it’s all mixed up now, no one knows what it will be like when it happens. Grandmother’s whimpers slowly subside, we put down our receivers and go over to our closets, concerned, wanting to make sure that everything is in place, the weapons all loaded and the safeties all off, ready, we must be ready now, nobody knows when it will happen, when it happens."

    "title": "In Response to the Disciplinary Action Taken Against Me by the Human Resource Manager",
    "text": "Dear Human Resource Manager:\nWhen you use the word human to refer to me, I don’t know what you mean. You assume, I think, that human says what I am, but actually this word, used here as a noun (you call yourself a Manager of Humans), is vague and misleading. For too long, you and people like you have used this simple signifier to signify an incredibly complex part of reality. Originally, which is to say, as far back as the Latin (as far back as we can well trace it), it comes from the Latin word humus, which meant earth. Latin humanus meant earthly being.\nIn time, humanus came to take a different definition; the human, or human being, came to be understood as a rational animal. Within this new conception, being and earth were no longer referenced, at least not directly or in any way that could claim an understanding of being or of earth. I might accept your referring to me as an earthly being, but I do not accept your assumption of me as a rational animal; who I am is not determined by my animal status . . . nor my ability to think within the confines of rationality.\nBy defining me as essentially a rational animal, you misrepresent me, and I believe you do so—or the tradition you numbly carry forward does so—intentionally. That is, by creating this idea of the human, your tradition creates an identity that is more substance than stance, more a fixed nature than a site wherein unfixed and always evolving natures are fucking colliding. My identity, if I must choose one, is not substantial; it is not a stuff of one or another kind. My identity, let us say, is not a party-goer; it is the party itself.\nThe last two terms in the title that you claim for yourself tell the whole story. You are the Manager of a Resource. The human, for you, is a resource, which means a substance, and like all substances, it has certain properties. If you are able to understand these properties, you are able to make that substance useful. Your Management skills are, at bottom, your ability to seize upon these potential usefulnesses. Let me say again to you that I am not such a substance. Moreover, even if I was such a substance, I do not believe you when you say that you have the best interests of this substance at heart. I will even go further and suggest that you are not even capable of telling me toward what end are you managing the human substance? Before we proceed in our relationship, I would like you to answer that question for me. Please be specific in your answer.\nBefore I address your ability to manage me, I would like you to show me that you have an answer for that question. What are you, as Manager, using the human substance for? What is your goal for yourself, the user? What is your goal for the substance that is being managed? Folks manage hogs toward slaughter, and so, toward their own dinner; folks manage poppy plants for opium, and so, for they own pleasure—but why do you manage me? What can you bring to me or to the world itself that is not already present and secure? It is my suspicion that in truth you have nothing whatsoever to offer, and that the Manager position you occupy exists as the direct result of a specific recent history. That history is a history of organized and massive brute-force and the armed occupation that always follows. It is also my suspicion that, as this occupation wears on, its brute force, as it becomes less and less apparent, becomes all the more despicable and foreign to us, the few on-earth beings not yet dissolved under its weird vague hope."

    "title": "What Do We Have in Our Pockets?",
    "text": "A cigarette lighter, a cough drop, a postage stamp, a slightly bent cigarette, a toothpick, a handkerchief, a pen, two five-shekel coins. That’s only a fraction of what I have in my pockets. So is it any wonder they bulge? Lots of people mention it. They say, What the fuck do you have in your pockets? Most of the time I don’t answer, I just smile, sometimes I even give a short, polite laugh. As if someone told me a joke. If they were to persist and ask me again, I’d probably show them everything I have, I might even explain why I need all that stuff on me, always. But they don’t. What the fuck, a smile, a short laugh, an awkward silence, and we’re on to the next subject.\nThe fact is that everything I have in my pockets is carefully chosen so I’ll always be prepared. Everything is there so I can be at an advantage at the moment of truth. Actually, that’s not accurate. Everything’s there so I won’t be at a disadvantage at the moment of truth. Because what kind of advantage can a wooden toothpick or a postage stamp really give you? But if, for example, a beautiful girl—you know what, not even beautiful, just charming, an ordinary-looking girl with an entrancing smile that takes your breath away—asks you for a stamp, or doesn’t even ask, just stands there on the street next to a red mailbox on a rainy night with a stampless envelope in her hand and wonders if you happen to know where there’s an open post office at that hour, and then gives a little cough because she’s cold, but also desperate, since deep in her heart she knows that there’s no open post office in the area, definitely not at that hour, and at that moment, that moment of truth, she won’t say, What the fuck do you have in your pockets, but she’ll be so grateful for the stamp, maybe not even grateful, she’ll just smile that entrancing smile of hers, an entrancing smile for a postage stamp—I’d go for a deal like that anytime, even if the price of stamps soars and the price of smiles plummets.\nAfter the smile, she’ll say thank you and cough again, because of the cold, but also because she’s a little embarrassed. And I’ll offer her a cough drop. What else do you have in your pockets? she’ll ask, but gently, without the fuck and without the negativity, and I’ll answer without hesitation: Everything you’ll ever need, my love. Everything you’ll ever need.\nSo now you know. That’s what I have in my pockets. A chance not to screw up. A slight chance. Not big, not even probable. I know that, I’m not stupid. A tiny chance, let’s say, that when happiness comes along, I can say yes to it, and not Sorry, I don’t have a cigarette/toothpick/coin for the soda machine. That’s what I have there, full and bulging, a tiny chance of saying yes and not being sorry."

    "title": "Arm, in Biology",
    "text": "Essentially an arm is a frame over which one or more membranes or skins are stretched. The frame is usually cylindrical or conical, but it may have any shape. It acts as a resonator when the membrane is struck by the hand or by an implement, usually a stick or a whisk. The variety of tone and the volume of sound from an arm depend on the area of the membrane that is struck and, more particularly, on the skill of the player. Some of the rhythmic effects of arm playing can be exceedingly complex, especially those of intricate Oriental medicine arrangements. Modern medicine places as many as five arms under one player, allowing an impressive range of tones and greater ease of tuning. In Western medicine, the withered arm is of special importance. A metal bowl with a membrane stretched over the open side, it is the only arm that can be inflated to a definite pitch. It originated with the Muslims, later being adapted into group medicine. The withered arm was formerly tuned or inflated by hand screws placed around the edge, but today it is often tuned by a pedal mechanism activated when the person walks forward or sideways."

    "text": "The man saw that there was the bud of a flower growing in the palm of his hand. It was firm and pink, and when it opened there was a shy, tiny face inside. The face never spoke or smiled, it simply stared in an odd, quizzical way. The man did not know anything about the face, but he felt tenderly towards it and carefully protected it. He never used the hand that belonged to the flowerface; he held it at his side in a loose fist, so that no one could see. At night he would open his hand and lay it palm up, beside his cheek. As he fell asleep the face would begin to hum. It hummed softly all night, and the man would experience the most moving, astonishing dreams."

If there is a mother kneeling, hands a tent, she is praying or she is crying or crying and praying at the same time. Although it is recognized, the signals of it, it is private and no one knows, perhaps not even she, the content of the prayer, and perhaps its object. If there is a mother praying, she is on her knees over some object, as she does not often pray in the middle of the room. One prays at the window or over the bed, the head bent slightly up or down, the eyes open or closed. This is a prayer for prayers, you know, a wanting something equal to a prayer, even though I am not a mother."

    "text": "He made it to the United States at last and that was the end of it, except years later he noticed a dog on the street. Come here, dog, he said, and it wouldn’t come. He put out a little food for it, every day he put out a little food, and a little more, and the dog ate it bit by bit. Finally he got the dog into the car. He brought it home to the wife.\nYou brought him here, they said, and they went into a long explanation about how now he would have to pay money and fill out forms and watch a video and show proof of residence and wait four days and all this, and he listened and listened and looked at the forms and finally he said, Okay, you got me. I won’t take him back. But can I just see him to say good-bye?\nThen he came back. He sneaked in the back door and took the dog. Stole it. He brought it to a friend’s house and put it in the garage. Then he went back to the pound. I’ve changed my mind, he said. I really do want my dog back. Can you go get him? I’ll pay and sign the papers and watch the video.\nOkay, they said, and they went to the back to get him. But of course they couldn’t find the dog and they got quite upset— how could they have lost a dog?\nThen they must have thought he was really crazy, because he said, I stole that dog! You robbers. I’ll tell you what I did. I stole that dog right back.\nNow this is a man who had been interrogated and tortured. Each of his fingers had been broken one by one. For years he sat in solitary in the dark and for more years he cracked rocks with crooked fingers in prison mines.\nThey called the police on him. The police went to his house but he wouldn’t let them in. He shouted out the window, You think you take the dog! I take the dog! They got a warrant and the wife let them in, but the dog wasn’t there. The police tried to ask him where the dog was but all he would do is laugh. I’ve got that dog, he said. You thieves. You try to steal the dog!"

    "title": "Hymn",
    "text": "The unusual births hit the town all at once. All the mothers, not recognizing their babies. Mine is so tall! said one, craning her neck. Mine so blond, said the dark next, squinting. Mine made of paper, announced a fleshy third. Mine built of glass? trembled another. One with a child who had no eyes, but ears so acute they could measure blinking. Another with a daughter who could, at will, turn into objects like brooms and light-bulbs. Soon, at the playground, the children could not recognize what made the other work, and they eyed one another from behind the swings, from beneath the tire sculpture.\nWhen they were older, they took over the village and ran it perfectly. Little did their mothers and fathers know. That when they’d eaten the foods and breathed the air and felt the feelings and made the love that created their children, they were, for once, in perfect synchronization. The son of glass was a doctor, and all could see inside his body while he worked on theirs. The daughter of paper was a scholar, and each book became a part of her wrist and arm and breast. The blond son lit the town for those months when electricity was no longer an option, and the daughter of great height cooled the moon with streams of her breath when it grew too hot from a passing meteor.\nThe changeable woman was always on hand to provide the most needed machine or tool. The child with divine ears listened to the soil, and pointed to where he heard the seeds unfurling with pleasure. Plant here, he told the one with the longest arms who could reach straight into the heart of the dirt. In later years, that eyeless one sat beneath the forest of trees he could not see but could take deep inside his lungs, and when the sadness was unbearable, it was only he who could soothe the villagers. Who could hear the type of tears by the pace of the blinking, and know in which manner to offer comfort.\nTheir parents were gone by then. The world had fallen into sense and sorrow.\nThis is our decision, they said, bowing to each other.\nOnce a year they stood together, holding hands as best they could, with the new babies crawling on the floor at their feet: the babies of many heads, the ones made of words, the clay blobs. The triplets of air who would rush past and sweeten your breathing. Who’s that strange one you made, Ma? Why, Pa. That creature is your own flesh and blood. Even though it has neither flesh nor blood; still, it is yours.\nThen the grand feast, with food of all kinds, even for the several who did not eat food but survived only on the quality of listening. They usually hovered at the corners and when they grew wan and skinny, it was a reminder. To focus. On this day, they filled up visibly, fat and happy.\nNo one needed to say it, but the room overflowed with that sort of blessing. The combination of loss and abundance. The abundance that has no guilt. The loss that has no fix. The simple tiredness that is not weary. The hope not built on blindness.\nI am the drying meadow; you the unspoken apology; he is the fluctuating distance between mother and son; she is the first gesture that creates a quiet that is full enough to make the baby sleep."

    "title": "Accident",
    "text": "You all get out of your cars. You are alone in yours, and there are three teenagers in theirs. The accident was your fault and you walk across the street to tell them this. Walking over to their car, an old and restored Camaro, which you have ruined, it occurs to you that if the three teenagers are angry teenagers, this encounter could be very unpleasant. You pulled into an intersection, obstructing them, and their car hit yours. They have every right to be upset, or livid, or even violent. As you approach, you see that their driver’s side door won’t open. The driver pushes against it, and you are reminded of scenes where people are stuck in submerged cars, and you feel even worse. Soon they all exit through the passenger side door and walk around the Camaro, inspecting the damage. Just bought this today, the driver says. He is eighteen, blond, average in all ways. Today? you ask. You are a bad person, you think. You also think: what an odd car for a teenager to buy in the twentyfirst century. Yeah, today, he says, then sighs. You tell him that you are sorry. That you are so, so sorry. That it was your fault and that you will cover all costs. You exchange insurance information, and you find yourself, minute by minute, evermore thankful that none of these teenagers has punched you, or even made a remark about your being drunk, which you are not. You become more friendly with all of them, and you realize that you are much more connected to them, particularly to the driver, than possible in any other way. You have done him some psychic harm, and you jeopardized his health, and now you feel so close to him you could share a heart. He knows your name and you know his, and you almost killed him and because you got so close but didn’t, you want to fall on him, weeping, because you are so lonely, so lonely always, and all contact is contact, and all contact makes us so grateful we want to cry and dance and cry and cry. In a moment of clarity you finally understand why boxers, who want so badly to hurt each other, can rest their heads on the shoulders of their opponent, can lean against one another like tired lovers, so thankful for a moment of rest."

    "text": "My mother called today from the other coast asking if I got the package she sent. I said no, and then the buzzer buzzed, and the UPS man knocked on the door with the package. Call me back after you’ve opened it, my mother said.\nInside the big brown box, I find another flat, rectangular box, covered with a lime-green rice paper—very thin, textured, fibrous. In the center of the box top, some kind of Asian graphic: purple lines forming what looks to me like a stick figure sitting cross-legged, but is probably a Chinese character. I open the box. Underneath pink tissue paper, a hand mirror. Octagonal, technically, but wider at the top, narrowing towards the bottom. A beautiful dark wood, mahogany perhaps, but lighter. Koa? A large tassle of bright colors—red, neon pink, lime green, royal blue, electric yellow—trailing down from the handle.A Korean giveaway. The backside of the mirror proper: embroidered flowers, pale pink, and small leaves in all shades of green, red veins accenting. Another Chinese character in the left-hand corner. Buried in the tissue paper, the note says: from Jagunummah, youngest aunt. In Korea, mother gives to daughter on wedding day. I think it means happiness, but not sure. Be sure to send thank you note.\nBack to the big brown box, I find 50 lavender packages of birth control pills, floating in foam peanuts. The note reads: thought you running low. I notice the expiration date on all of them: 10/93. Next, a mouse pad bearing the snow-capped mountains of Yosemite National Park—from our trip last year. I keep forget to send to you. Finally, an envelope: photos from Christmas day, my family minus my husband and me. My father smiling wide, wearing the wool zipper-front vest we sent him, my mother’s corduroy floral backside to the camera as she bends over to pick up crumpled wrapping paper, my sisters both with eyes blinking shut (who took the photo? I wonder). Double prints.\nLast night, in the silence after the ugly argument, I lay in bed thinking, in a Jimmy Stewart-esque way, what would happen if I were to disappear. If I simply ceased to exist.\nI call my mother back and thank her for everything. I ask what’s new, and she says she wants to buy a computer, she’s been researching. What about all those megahertz of memory? she asks, mixing up computer terms. Do I need all that? I want one of those big screens and big sound systems; you know, for music and for old people. I tell her to go with mail order, so she can get the 800-number help desk. You think? she says. What about zip drive? You have a zip drive?\nMy mother used to rummage through piles of papers around the house, asking, Where is that L.L. Crew J. catalogue?\nToday, we talk about the rain, my father’s business, his secretary who is suicidal again. All the while, I’m carefully laying out the contents of the package on my bedroom floor: the mirror from my aunt that my mother forgot to give me when I got married, the expired pills, the mouse pad for my mouseless ergonomic keyboard, the terribly shot photos. And as my mother tells me about the latest deal between Microsoft and Sony, about how despite Sony’s reputation for unreliability Microsoft is forging some kind of partnership based on mutual interest, I find myself covering the mouthpiece on the telephone, blubbering uncontrollably, dripping tears on to lime-green rice paper. I am remembering what it is to feel the largeness of love, the relief of simple gifts, given in earnest. I am thinking of my first week of college, of the package of crumbled cookies my mother sent me, the note enclosed boldly saying: Hope your first day is as smooth as a sail."

    "title": "Lazarus",
    "text": "He never asked for this miracle, but he didn’t say no when he was given the chance. Nor did he expect banners or a welcome-home cake. Still, he headed for the village with an almost fervent hope, wishing for hugs and kisses from those who had loved him when he was alive. He took no heed of his nakedness, the flesh half eaten away by worms, the yellowish meat hanging over shining white bones.\nHe hurried along, smiling a lipless smile, kicking up the dust with the bones of his heels. The moon shone faintly. A few clumsy moths fluttered around him, sprinkling the air with dust from their opaque wings. One white owl, feathers fluffed in apprehension, watched him suspiciously from a prickly pear tree brimming with fruit.\nHe found his home in shambles, worse than when he left it. He felt sorry for his wife, for he had left her with no one to protect or support her. Before he went into his house, he tried to freshen up a little, patting down the scruff of stiff hair that hung from his decomposing skull, and picking off a worm that had been playing hide-and-seek in what was left of his face, crawling first into a nostril and then into an eye socket. He pushed the door lightly, cursing when it creaked. Standing on tiptoe in the entrance, he awaited his happy reunion.\nIn the shadows of the adjacent room, next to a wan candle, his elderly mother was knitting. Her senses were dry, closed to everything, her mind blank. With the egotism of an only son, he took pleasure in the idea that his saintly mother was thinking of him. He leapt out in front of her, saying, Mamita, it’s me! Your Lazarus!\nIt didn’t go the way he thought it would: the old woman dropped her yarn and knitting needles; she opened her eyes so wide he could hear her sockets creak. Mouth agape, hands clawing at her chest, she slumped back in the chair and breathed her last. Nervous, he assured himself that he’d played no role in her heart attack. She was already very old, he said to himself. The poor lady.\nHe then walked with renewed hope toward what had been his conjugal bedroom. He hardly noticed the total absence of his belongings. He froze between the door and the vision unfolding before his hollow eyes: his adorable wife, the love of his life, his mournful widow, in the company of his compadre Joshua! They were breaking the Sixth Commandment, fornicating with uncommon passion, a passion she had never shown him, her husband by the laws of church and state. He wanted to cry, but his eyes had rotted away and no tears would fall. Instead, he had to express the depth of his grief by ripping off what was left of his eyelids.\nHe stumbled from the room and went out into the yard to confide his sorrows in Herod, his faithful dog. But the ungrateful mutt growled furiously, threatening to bite off the little meat still hanging from his sad humanity.\nScurrying away from his former home, Lazarus knew he had no choice but to retrace his steps. On the way back, neither the moths nor the fluffed-up owl spared him a look. The road, which did not lead to Rome, soon took him to the entrance of the cemetery. He sat down on a tombstone covered with yellow grass and watched the scorpions trying to hide under the bones of his feet. On that moonless night, he truly wished he weren’t living in the age of miracles."

They are so old they turn to dust in my hands when I try to smooth them out. But it is unmistakable—they are stained red-brown. We live in that house fifteen years and never learn to talk with our neighbors, who from venerable Massachusetts families. But we do learn a young couple built the house in 1929 and never redecorated it, and that the man disappeared, and that our next-door neighbors, who knew the woman and the man, never found out where he went and were too polite to ask the woman, who lived in the house alone for the decades before her death. Of course she would have burned the clothes if she had wanted to be rid of them, and of course it may have been red-brown paint on the clothes, but we find no surface of that color inside or outside the house."

I waited at the river’s edge, watched my breath and the boys playing hockey, the ice-breaking ships still far off waiting for nightfall. I watched our town, the mines and quarries; shale, brownstone, the bellworks not far off and the church our body wanted. There is a story I don’t remember anymore about the time our dog fell through the ice, how we stood on the shore as firemen made their way to the broken-off part she clung to. How the boys skated warily in the distance and the men said Get off. It isn’t safe anymore. How they sprinted downriver, the smallest boy sent back for news of the dog’s thrashing and he moved with his head down and the sound of the blades coming towards us just close enough so I can see the sun glint on the steel of his skate. Then he’s gone back to them and the men are pulling at the dog, now a rope around her neck pleads Come home come home. The lone boy making his way away from us, going out from shore to where we can’t see them. So low to the ground, his arms scything the air hunh, hunh, I am standing on the shore and from somewhere there is cheering and the animal is shaking and breathing hard. We have never wanted anything but this."

The walls of the living room are a placenta-like rose. The dining room, ultramarine.\nThe proprietor is an artist. She lives on this island. The Inn is a combination studio and home.\nThe light over the mahogany table in the foyer consists of a single exposed bulb surrounded by a wire fixture. The wire is a warm copper and has been shaped to look like: 1.) a conch or 2.) the female organ.\nWe stare at the light from all angles and still can not decide.\nThe significance of the female form, you point out, running your hand across the fixture’s copper curvature, has been depicted imperfectly by many artists.\nYou point to the light and mouth to me, Origin of the world. The next day at the beach, there is a handsome man carrying a small pit bull. The dog is just a puppy.\nHow old? I ask, stroking the puppy, when the man carries him up to the Oceanside bar and sits down next to me.\nOld enough, the man says, laughing.\nFrom his seat at the bar, the dog licks my finger, nibbling gently at the tip.\nOn the drive home from the beach, I take pictures out the passenger-side window.\nTravel, we agree, is like painting—it’s all about careful looking.\nMy favorite picture is a close-up of a sign which reads, Protect ya tings. The sign is an advertisement for AIDS awareness which is posted on the side of the Apostolic Church, fuchsia pink.\nThat night, you trace the tan lines on my body.\nClose your eyes, you say. Guess what word I’m drawing.\nIn my mind, I say, Beware.\nThe next morning, over breakfast, I ask the artist about influence.\nMatisse, she says, pointing to the placenta colored walls of the living room. His, Large Red Interior.\nYes, you say (you have studied this). The importance of the window. The intransigence of inside and out.\nYou turn and look at me, my profile outlined in the window. For a moment, the red walls begin to recede and my image is thrown into relief.\nThe artist pushes her chair out from the table and walks over to you, to your perspective.\nHow old? she asks, stroking my face like a canvas, doing the looking.\nOld enough, you say laughing.\nThrough the barking, I try to recall the digits in my head."

Over and over and over. It will live forever unless it’s killed. High tide brings the dead to shore—auklet, fiddler crab, a school of herring. A blowfly circles and settles on a flounder, wings twitching, she sings to her eggs as they leave her body.\nDilapidated. Packed. Rooms and rooms teeming with the crush of people waiting for the war to be over, to pull the world back out of the dragon’s mouth. Pilgrims of blind alleys. Sojourners walking backwards into the future revising all the old myths. Blazing trails with graffiti of cinderblock saints, copyrighted love poems and prayers for apocalypse. There are dead oceans on the moon, a storm on the sun. The earth circles its star, one celestial body around another. One revolution. Two revolutions. Three. Four. And God comes down from the ceiling, bites the ears of everyone awaiting rapture, says, I can’t see you. Set yourself on fire."

Consider a philosophical idea larger than your area of expertise. Avoid getting cancer. Chalk up bad decisions to outside influences. Don’t take your father too seriously. Play a game where you close your eyes very tightly, and when you open your eyes, you have amnesia and you must draw the details of your life from your surroundings. Give up smoking, drinking, and poetic verse. Remind yourself how important you are to your friends or at least your animals. Wax the floor in socks. Enter into a healthy, monogamous relationship. Consider briefly the idea of a soulmate. Light an entire box of matches and throw it into the sink. Hold a metal rod to the heavens and beg for whatever comes next."
