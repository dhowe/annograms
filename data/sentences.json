[
  "A snake with honey-coloured eyes survived and told what had happened.",
  "In our burning fields, she drew me with the spittle of its mouth on a charred wall, like a blackboard in front of frightened pupils.",
  "Thus you saw in me the image of my father, throwing my last pennies into the fountain of death, then sewing the buttons of his oil-green coat in the furrows of mud where you had planted seeds, arranged in the form of words, and they grew and blossomed when light rained down, warm as remorse, and again blood was made to flow on the palms of the earth.",
  "Canes grew high as poplars and we broke them to roof our refuge, and we jumped over our vein-streams to swim in our first sky.",
  "We fertilised our language with our debris.",
  "Mountains had become ripe heads for the fists of the sky and the slopes cheeks we ran down like melted ice, and at every point where the disappeared had fallen an unattainable flower sprang up, or a burning matchstick flickered before a schoolboy could close his mouth over it to put out the flame as he hurries to do his homework on forgetting fear.",
  "We will remember for a long time how we were before this harvest.",
  "Each of us will visit his own grave, carrying a whip on his shoulder, or behind his back a sickle or a knife.",
  "Time was a game.",
  "We bade farewell to our beds that had been smashed by our dreams.",
  "Gamblers offered us a moon that crumbled to dust at the touch of our fingers.",
  "Rats offered us their eyes as stars.",
  "Hunger blazed its suns behind our foreheads.",
  "Books we hadn’t read flittered down and landed on our ulcers.",
  "Great silences seeped through our bandages.",
  "No one uttered a word.",
  "The dots and signs with which we ended our lines leapt towards the words scattered about them, and all meanings changed.",
  "It was the year my brother died, I lived up north and had few friends or they all went away.",
  "Christmas Day I was sitting in my armchair, reading something about Hegel.",
  "You will forgive me if you are someone who knows a lot of Hegel or understands it, I do not and will paraphrase badly, but I understood him to be saying he was fed up with popular criticism of his terrible prose and claiming that conventional grammar, with its clumsy dichotomy of subject and verb, was in conflict with what he called speculation’.",
  "Speculation being the proper business of philosophy.",
  "Speculation being the effort to grasp reality in its interactive entirety.",
  "The function of a sentence like Reason is Spirit was not to assert a fact he said but to lay Reason side by side with Spirit and allow their meanings to tenderly mingle in speculation.",
  "I was overjoyed by this notion of a philosophic space where words drift in gentle mutual redefinition of one another but, at the same time, wretchedly lonely with all my family dead and here it was Christmas Day, so I put on big boots and coat and went out to do some snow standing.",
  "Not since childhood.",
  "I had forgot how astounding it is.",
  "I went to the middle of a woods.",
  "Fir trees, the teachers of this, all around.",
  "Minus twenty degrees in the wind but inside the trees is no wind.",
  "The world subtracts itself in layers.",
  "Outer sounds like traffic and shoveling vanish.",
  "Inner sounds become audible, cracks, sighs, caresses, twigs, birdbreath, toenails of squirrel.",
  "The fir trees move hugely.",
  "The white is perfectly curved, stunned with itself.",
  "Puffs of ice fog and some gold things float up.",
  "Shadows rake their motionlessness across the snow with a vibration of other shadows moving crosswise on them, shadow on shadow, in precise velocities.",
  "It is very cold, then that, too, begins to subtract itself, the body chills on its surface but the core is hot and it is possible to disconnect the surface, withdraw to the core, where a ravishing peace flows in, so ravishing I am unembarrassed to use the word ravishing, and it is not a peace of separation from the senses but the washing-through peace of looking, listening, feeling, at the very core of snow, at the very core of the care of snow.",
  "It has nothing to do with Hegel and he would not admire the clumsily conventional sentences in which I have tried to tell about it but I suspect, if I hadn’t been trying on the mood of Hegel’s particular grammatical indignation that Christmas Day, I would never have gone out to stand in the snow, or stayed to speculate with it, or had the patience to sit down and make a record of speculation for myself as if it were a worthy way to spend an afternoon, a plausible way to change the icy horror of holiday into a sort of homecoming.",
  "Merry Christmas from Hegel.",
  "How was it that till questioned, till displaced in the attempt to answer, I had scarcely thought of myself as having a country, or indeed as having left a country?",
  "The answer lies peripherally in looming, in hinterland; primarily in the tongueless, palpitating interiority.",
  "In the same way, some confident speakers do not think of themselves as having an accent.",
  "They will say so: I don’t have an accent.",
  "You have an accent.",
  "In those accentless voices compass points spin, ochre and ultramarine flagella fling themselves identifiably towards this that or the other region.",
  "It is a motile version of that luxury, solidity, non-reflectivity that is the assumption of patria.",
  "So different is the expat from the refugee, who has her country on her back, or the migrant, who has countries at his back.",
  "What would I have called home, before I began creating home?",
  "Before I had to learn to ravel up longitude, latitude, population, oil rigs, mobile phone masts, prayer flags, legality of fireworks, likely use of firearms, density and disappearance of forests, scarlet ibis, other stripes of scarlet, into a by-listeners-unvisited, communicable, substantial image of Trinidad’?",
  "Language is my home.",
  "It is alive other than in speech.",
  "It is beyond a thing to be carried with me.",
  "It is ineluctable, variegated and muscular.",
  "A flicker and drag emanates from the idea of it.",
  "Language seems capable of girding the oceanic earth, like the world-serpent of Norse legend.",
  "It is as if language places a shaping pressure upon our territories of habitation and voyage; thrashing, independent, threatening to rive our known world apart.",
  "Yet thought is not bounded by language.",
  "At least, my experience of thinking does not appear so bound.",
  "One day I lost the words wall and floor.",
  "There seemed no reason to conceive of a division.",
  "The skirting-board suddenly reduced itself to a nervous gentrification, a cover-up of some kind; nothing especially marked.",
  "The room was an inward-focused container.",
  "Wall’, floor’, even ceiling’, doorway’, shutters started to flow smoothly, like a red ribbed tank top over a heaving ribcage.",
  "Room grew into quarter.",
  "Room became segment.",
  "Line yearned till it popped into curve.",
  "The imperfections of what had been built or installed: the ragged windowframe or peeling tile: had no power to reclaim human attention to floor or wall as such.",
  "Objects were tethered like astronauts and a timid fringe of disarrayed atmosphere was the immediate past that human activity kept restyling into present.",
  "The interiority of the room was in continuous flow.",
  "Wall, floor became usable words again in a sort of silence.",
  "I had the sense to shut up about the languageless perception.",
  "Procedure for living.",
  "Language is my home, I say; not one particular language.",
  "This morning on the bus there was a woman carrying a bag with inspirational sayings and positive affirmations which I was reading because I’m a fan of inspirational sayings and positive affirmations.",
  "I also like clothing that gives you advice.",
  "What’s better than the glittered baseball cap of a stranger telling you what to strive for?",
  "It’s like living in a world of therapists.",
  "The inspirational bag of the woman on the bus said a number of things like live in the moment and remember to breathe but it also said children are the orgasm of the world’.",
  "Are children the orgasm of the world like orgasms are the orgasms of sex?",
  "Are children the orgasm of anything?",
  "Children are the orgasm of the world like hovercraft are the orgasm of the future or silence is the orgasm of the telephone, or shit is the orgasm of the lasagne.",
  "You could even say sheep are the orgasm of lonely pastures, which are the orgasm of modern farming practices which are the orgasm of the industrial revolution.",
  "And then I thought why not?",
  "I like comparing things to other things too.",
  "Like sometimes when we’re having sex and you look like a helicopter in a low-budget movie, disappearing behind a cloud to explode.",
  "Or an athlete winning a prestigious sporting tournament at the exact moment he realises his wife has been cheating on him.",
  "For the most part, orgasms are the orgasms of the world.",
  "Like slam-dunking a glass basketball.",
  "Or executing a perfect dive into a swimming pool full of oh my god.",
  "Or travelling into the past to forgive yourself and creating a time paradox so complex it forces all of human history to reboot, stranding you naked on some rocky outcrop, looking up at the sunset from a world so new looking up hasn’t even been invented yet.",
  "Bring down the lights.",
  "Bring out the stars.",
  "Let the record sing; the vibraphone; the violin; the gong.",
  "We call this charm a festooned gazebo in twilight.",
  "We call night and her creatures to the summer screen; every beat a wheel every wheel aglow.",
  "The soft tight musical light a freshet.",
  "And happy who can hear the wood, the ferns bobbing, the stars splashing down.",
  "I wanted this glad light happy light inside the gloaming.",
  "I wanted glow.",
  "The piping anthem of a voyage listing in lamplight, oboe light; hear it and fly.",
  "Hear it fly like friendship like modernism beginning like a steamer pulling out to sea in an old reel dreaming.",
  "Married to a song; to a pebble of song.",
  "It has a broad axe shape, but is sliver-thin.",
  "Even at the blunt end, the ochre-coloured flint, smoothed and polished, is a slim-line product.",
  "It looks like a small spatula, and would be something of a puzzle to archaeology, but speculation is pointless, rendered futile at a touch.",
  "The obliging object tells the hand exactly where it wants to go.",
  "As soon as I picked it up, the long haft made itself at home, slung between first finger and thumb on the elastic webbing of skin.",
  "The first fingerpad went straight to the back of the blade.",
  "After three thousand years of dumb neglect, the instrument was attuned, responsive, prompt to its ancient cue.",
  "The leading edge is minutely pecked.",
  "Broken small craters, overlapping scoops, were quickly opened up in the glassy stone by the same degree of force aimed repeatedly, dozens of times, at the same hard margin of a few fingers breadth.",
  "The life-knowledge of the flint-knapper dwells in the sparing of exertion at the very point of landing a blow.",
  "The effects of this knowledge, the depth and shape of indentations in the stone, are accordingly generic if not uniform.",
  "An even more precise and unthinking calculation is needed for end-on strokes that split the individual flint.",
  "At some point the maker, under the spell of making, no longer sees the use to which the blade is put, seeing instead the bloom of a new shape begin to emerge from the flint’s uncertain depths.",
  "Sometimes this shape is only poorly divined, or glimpsed and avoided; sometimes it is nursed into life, by craftsmen who watch for the ideal form of knife-being, especially if this is a votive blade, intended for ritual deposit.",
  "Best of all is when the artist, setting his sights on perfect function, sees it rise above the horizon at the same point as beauty of form.",
  "This tool for cutting was neither deposited nor lost.",
  "I think it was left beneath the roots of a broad oak with a clutter of flints, worked but unfinished, until the maker should return, and return soon.",
  "There it lay until the sea covered all the oaks whose stumps are now below the tides at Holme-next-the-Sea.",
  "Lying there through storms that uncovered the massive inverted bole of roots at the centre of Seahenge, close by, it found another hand to belabour, to switch on, to gear up, when just enough sand had been swished aside for its pale surface to draw the eye.",
  "It may never have been used, but was made for a hand that used others like it, and it would always transmit the same feeling for action, the same possible uses for butchery: severing, slicing, scraping.",
  "It was the lever between inner and outer worlds, it showed that the airs and waters, rocks and earth, moving and combining and resisting one another, obeying the spirits that ruled them, had their equivalent workings, their times of calm and upheaval, under the skin; in the wallowing lungs, the weeping flesh, the flowing heart, and in all the symmetries of bones and muscles, the asymmetries of lower organs, the random belt of the guts.",
  "It brought the cross-sections of life within grasp.",
  "Behind it, the physician’s trial and error, the surgeon’s initiative; the whole breathing, faltering body of science.",
  "I will soon write a long, sad book called A Woman Shopping.",
  "It will be a book about what we are required to do and also a book about what we are hated for doing.",
  "It will be a book about envy and a book about barely visible things.",
  "This book would be a book also about the history of literature and literature’s uses against women, also against literature and for it, also against shopping and for it.",
  "The flâneur is a poet is an agent free of purses, but a woman is not a woman without a strap over her shoulder or a clutch in her hand.",
  "Lavish descriptions of the perverse or decadently feminized marketplace, some long sentences concerning the shipping and distribution of alterity, an entire chapter about Tender Buttons in which each sentence is only a question.",
  "And from where did that mutton, that roast beef, that carafe come?",
  "But who would publish this book and who, also, would shop for it?",
  "And how could it be literature if it is not coyly against literature, but sincerely against it, as it is also against ourselves?",
  "In April 1979, I was ten years old.",
  "This is a short talk about vectors.",
  "It’s about Brueghel’s Icarus.",
  "It’s about a girl walking home from school at the exact moment her neighbour laces up his Doc Martens, tight.",
  "It’s about a partial and irrelevant nudity.",
  "It’s about the novel as a form that processes the part of a scene that doesn’t function as an image, but as the depleted, yet still livid mixture of materials that a race riot is made from.",
  "Think of the sky.",
  "Think of the clear April day with its cardigans and late afternoon rain shower.",
  "Think of the indigo sky lowering over London like a lid.",
  "Think of Blair Peach, the anti-racism campaigner and recent emigrant from New Zealand, who will die before this day is out.",
  "Think about a cyborg to get to the immigrant.",
  "Think of a colony.",
  "Think of the red and white daikon radishes in a tilted box on the pavement outside Dokal and Sons, on the corner of Uxbridge Road and Lansbury Drive.",
  "Think of the road, which here we call asphalt: there, it is bitty.",
  "It is a dark silver with milky oil seams.",
  "A patch up job, Labour still in power, but not for long.",
  "It’s 1979, St. George’s Day, and the Far Right has decided to have its annual meeting in a council-run meeting hall in Southall, Middlesex, a London suburb in which it would be rare nauseating to see a white face.",
  "To see anyone, actually.",
  "Everyone can tell what’s coming.",
  "It’s not a riot, at this point, but a simple protest in an outlying area of London, an immigrant suburb: a banlieue.",
  "Everyone knows to board the glass up, draw the curtains and lie down.",
  "Lie down between the hand-sewn quilts shipped from India in a crate then covered in an outer cotton case stitched to the padding with a fine pink thread.",
  "The quilts smell of an antiseptic powder, an anti-fungal, Mars.",
  "We lie down beneath the blankets in front of the fire.",
  "It’s 1979, so there’s a small gas fire and a waist-high fridge, where we keep our milk and our bread and our cheese, right there, in the living room.",
  "It’s 1979, and so I live in Hayes, though in two months, we’ll put our house on the market and move.",
  "There were barnacles that marked the edges of oceans.",
  "Late scramblers on the rocks could feel their calcic ridges stoving sharply underfoot.",
  "The wet rocks glittered beneath and in the wind they smelled of verdigris.",
  "The barnacles fused in intricate settlements.",
  "For their whole lives they cleaved, and in turn the fragile rock cleaved to them.",
  "Volcanoes and thimbles and strange constellations.",
  "Together they mapped distant cities and willed the sea to overtake them.",
  "And when the russet tide came they opened themselves like unfamiliar lovers.",
  "The whole thing some actinic principle: a forest grew up in a second, to grace a world where the sun was a watery lamp.",
  "Where none had been before, white mouths frilled softly in the current and squat armour issued forth the unlikeliest of cilia: transparent, lightly haired, cherishing each updraft as, feathered, they moved with it.",
  "They only existed for that half-sunk terrain.",
  "And as they briefly lived, those tender quills wrote of their mystery.",
  "I’d been hoping to spare you any further musings I might have had on the nature of Iain Duncan Smith, that talking claw.",
  "But perhaps we’re at a point now where we need to define him, to recite and describe, occupy his constellations.",
  "Because to recite the stations of the being of Iain Duncan Smith, as if they were a string of joy-beads, and they are, would be to recite the history of the law, if we take that law to be something as simple as a mouth is, and each noise, each syllable that emits from that mouth is only ever and never more than the sound of animals eating each other, a gap in the senses where the invisible universe goes to die, and we become like ghosts or insomniacs stumbling through the city, we become the music of Iain Duncan Smith, his origin in the chaos of animals and plants, of rocks and metals and the countless earths, where over and again he breaks children’s teeth with gravel-stones, covers them with ashes.",
  "Because to classify those stations, the cancer-ladder of the dreams of Iain Duncan Smith might, at a push, be to consume him, and to define those stations, those marks on the hide of Iain Duncan Smith, might be to trap him, to press granite to the roof of his mouth, the stations of the law.",
  "And at this point, obviously, I really wish I could think of something to say that was hopeful, that was useful, that was not simply a net of rats blocking the force of the sun, till it crawls on its fists and knees, screaming like a motherfucker, sarcastic and wrathful, boiling the mountains as if they were scars, laughing, laughing like a crucifixion, modular and bleached.",
  "Bleached with the guts of Iain Duncan Smith, of each of the modest number of words he actually understands, such as grovel and stingray and throat, chlamydia, wart.",
  "And those five words are the entirety of the senses of Iain Duncan Smith, the gates to his city, his recitation of the germs of the law, a clock that never strikes and never stops, where we are not counted, wiped from the knots of statistics, comparable to fine gold, receptacles of song, shrieking gulls.",
  "It’s all I can bear to listen to, that shrieking.",
  "It blocks out the stars, the malevolent alphabet he’s been proposing.",
  "When you are alone and too tired even to turn on any of your devices, you let yourself linger in a past stacked among pillows.",
  "Usually you are nestled under blankets and the house is empty.",
  "Sometimes the moon is missing and beyond the windows the low, gray ceiling seems approachable.",
  "Its dark light dims in degrees depending on the density of clouds and you fall back into that which gets reconstructed as metaphor.",
  "The route is often associative.",
  "You smell good.",
  "You are twelve attending school on White Plains Road and the girl sitting in the seat behind asks you to lean to the right during exams so she can copy what you have written.",
  "Sister Evelyn is in the habit of taping the 100s and the failing grades to the coat closet doors.",
  "The girl is Catholic with waist-length brown hair.",
  "You can’t remember her name.",
  "You never really speak except for the time she makes her request and later when she tells you you smell good and have features more like a white person.",
  "You assume she thinks she is thanking you for letting her cheat and feels better cheating from an almost white person.",
  "Sister Evelyn never figures out your arrangement perhaps because you never turn around to copy Mary Catherine’s answers.",
  "Sister Evelyn must think these two girls think a lot alike or she cares less about cheating and more about humiliation or she never actually saw you sitting there.",
  "The new therapist specializes in trauma counseling.",
  "You have only ever spoken on the phone.",
  "Her house has a side gate that leads to a back entrance she uses for patients.",
  "You walk down a path bordered on both sides with deer grass and rosemary to the gate, which turns out to be locked.",
  "At the front door the bell is a small round disc that you press firmly.",
  "When the door finally opens, the woman standing there yells, at the top of her lungs, Get away from my house.",
  "What are you doing in my yard?",
  "It’s as if a wounded Doberman pinscher or a German shepherd has gained the power of speech.",
  "And though you back up a few steps, you manage to tell her you have an appointment.",
  "You have an appointment?",
  "She spits back.",
  "Then she pauses.",
  "I am sorry.",
  "I am so sorry, so, so sorry.",
  "A friend writes of the numbing effects of humming and it returns you to your own sigh.",
  "It’s no longer audible.",
  "You’ve grown into it.",
  "Some call it aging an internalized liquid smoke blurring ordinary ache.",
  "Come on, get back in the car.",
  "Your partner wants to face off with a mouth and who knows what handheld objects the other vehicle carries.",
  "Trayvon Martin’s name sounds from the car radio a dozen times each half hour.",
  "You pull your love back into the seat because though no one seems to be chasing you, the justice system has other plans.",
  "Yes, and this is how you are a citizen: Come on.",
  "Let it go.",
  "Despite the air-conditioning you pull the button back and the window slides down into its door-sleeve.",
  "A breeze touches your cheek.",
  "As something should.",
  "Remove any remaining teeth which still have amalgam fillings, and dispose of them in a hazardous waste facility.",
  "Cast a rectangular coffin in inch-thick magnesium, total surface area approximately K square inches, the equivalent of J pages.",
  "Use letter punches to stamp the inner and outer surfaces of the coffin with the text of this book, and of the Poésies of Stéphane Mallarmé.",
  "Pour a layer of white granulated sugar into the coffin, to a depth of half the difference between the interior height of the coffin and the thickness of my corpse.",
  "Lay my corpse on its back, fully dressed, on the sugar.",
  "Place an Elrathia kingii trilobite, free of all matrix, over each of my eyes; an enrolled Phacops rana trilobite in my navel, under my shirt; and the large, testicles-shaped fragment of mediaeval masonry you will find among my personal effects, over my genital area, with the balls pointing down.",
  "Put the polished section of Madagascan ammonite I always carry with me into my left-hand trouser pocket.",
  "Lay two small canisters of oxygen, and two small canisters of propane gas, beside my corpse, one of each on either side.",
  "Fill up the remaining volume of the coffin with powdered ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and figure out how to hermetically seal a magnesium coffin.",
  "Lay the coffin on a pyre of sustainable Scottish oak wood, built wherever seems most appropriate and constructive to you at the time.",
  "Light the pyre.",
  "Don’t actually do this.",
  "To dignify a room needs no more than unusual attention to the usual.",
  "The corner of a glass table with the CD case lying on it, the orchid above still flowering after six months.",
  "It’s as though a challenge has been issued to time itself.",
  "The bronze face of a girl in sleep or ecstasy makes no comment upon the competing efforts of these things to behave as if they could control time.",
  "The orchid’s petals, like pink propellers frozen in a downwards plunge, a suspended cataclysm, have dared to endure; the music, whose case it is, has moved away on its own, as if to expend itself.",
  "One is still, one enlarged.",
  "Yet only one is growing unpredictably; the other knows its direction and directions.",
  "Does it matter?",
  "Both are doomed.",
  "Each outwits regulation for the time it takes, and for what time takes from it.",
  "The laser will eventually have nothing left spinning to decode, and the stalk will cease to transmit the life that qualifies stillness in the veined blush of the flower.",
  "Only the bronze face is content to be measured by time.",
  "Her eyes are narrowed, and her slight smile suspends all clocks.",
  "Sharing this for the moment that I drain my glass, I reflect that the page is no partisan.",
  "Everything has some claim upon it equally.",
  "They were all set upon their courses, and must see them through.",
  "The page woos them, but they make no response other than to be themselves.",
  "Eventually the page apologises, and is silent.",
  "I approach Nairobi, thrown into the mass of old avenues.",
  "I have a map of the old town and what the streets used to be called, government road and the little place where Lord Delamere liked to be the asshole, all regards to the dead.",
  "And in the eyes of people are azaleas blooming and popping like bubblegum carried up to perch in the branches of a blue I & M tree, there where the transmission has been telling us consumption begins and ends when our bodies decide.",
  "We are lapping against each other, our bodies not touching, our intentions quite clear, our beds unmade.",
  "A naiad, completely given up to sighs and biting its fingernails, winks at me.",
  "I am the inconsolable.",
  "She gives me back a second of my celebratory youth.",
  "I am not approached by beggars although to feel at home my eyes beg for some reprieve from the eyes of another traveler who has misplaced his airplane in the middle of the street where it is okay to hold the arms of a stranger until you have crossed the road.",
  "In the old streets I besiege a man to translate the poems on the walls, on the bodies of women, on the lumps that are hanging from their men.",
  "Gross desire is a river tapestry with water like ribbons he tells me.",
  "For a week I travel on business, and on the fourth afternoon, I go to a restaurant to have yet another meal alone.",
  "I order a Greek salad and read a Dickens novel to escape my loneliness.",
  "When the salad arrives, I barely look.",
  "How will Jenny Wren respond to news of her drunken father’s death?",
  "I push the fork into the lettuce, and it yields slowly to the tines.",
  "The balance of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, with the sweetness of the red lettuce, is perfect, and I pause, relishing the flavour.",
  "I hear the smallest of shrieks.",
  "I think I must have anticipated Jenny, that I must have been that engrossed, when I hear it again.",
  "I put my book down so its open pages press the plastic tablecloth and keep my place, and my fork dives again, spearing a cube of feta.",
  "The sound rises from the salad.",
  "Who what are you?",
  "Where are you?",
  "A black olive wiggles atop a romaine leaf, as though to wave.",
  "I am your son, brutally transformed.",
  "I glance around the restaurant and see the other diners, all in groups, engaged in conversation.",
  "When I last saw you, you were an infant.",
  "How did you get into this state?",
  "I say with some sharpness.",
  "I think I see him cringe.",
  "Meekly, he says, I fell in love with the virgin mistress of the god’s own olive grove.",
  "When I made love to her, I was turned into an olive tree.",
  "When you made love to her?",
  "The softest of whispers: They say, when I raped her.",
  "So you are a tree as well as this olive?",
  "I ask, trying to move my mouth as little as possible as I see the waiter coming from the kitchen.",
  "So she tends to you, there in the grove?",
  "She only knows I disappeared, the olive whines.",
  "She tends to me, yes, but without thought, without love.",
  "Delicious, I say to the waiter, swallowing the small olive whole.",
  "Fairies begin their day by coming together a moment and sharing joy.",
  "They love the feeling, which dew on the leaves draws from grass, lilacs and the response of meadow and flowers to the dawn.",
  "Diminutive green sylphs now run in the grass, whose growth seems intimately associated with theirs, a single line of concentration.",
  "They talk to themselves, constantly repeating, with an intensity causing their etheric doubles, grass, to vibrate as they pass, vivifying growth.",
  "To rabbits and young children they’re visible, but I see points of light, tiny clouds of color and gleams of movement.",
  "The lawn is covered with these flashes.",
  "In low alyssums along a border, one exquisite, tiny being plays around stems, passing in and out of each bud.",
  "She’s happy and feels much affection for the plants, which she regards as her own body.",
  "The material of her actual body is loosely knit as steam or a colored gas, bright apple-green or yellow, and is very close to emotion.",
  "Tenderness for plants shows as rose; sympathy for their growth and adaptability as flashes of emerald.",
  "When she feels joy, her body responds all-over with a desire to be somewhere or do something for plants.",
  "Hers is not a world of surfaces skin, husks, bark with definite edges and identities.",
  "Trees appear as columns of light melting into surroundings where form is discerned, but is glowing, transparent, mingling like breath.",
  "She tends to a plant by maintaining fusion between the plant’s form and life-vitality contained within.",
  "She works as part of nature’s massed intelligence to express the involution of awareness or consciousness into a form.",
  "And she includes vitality, because one element of form is action.",
  "Sprouting, branching, leafing, blossoming, crumbling to humus are all form to a fairy.",
  "Observatory dome, vertical and horizontal curves, mobile staircase leading to a large telescope, wheels, cranks, large gyration systems, eyepieces, lens, and in front, table and chair: two figures seated at the table, scholars leaning over their calculations in puzzlement, drops of sweat splash, the figure comes towards them concentration.",
  "Simple background, table and chair: the figure approaches one of the scholar figures who indicates silence, drops of sweat splash imperative gesture.",
  "Simple background, table and chairs: whilst one of the scholar figures sits and calculates, symbols all around, drops of sweat splash, the other scholar justifies or tries to explain invitation to go and look.",
  "Mobile staircase leading to a large telescope: the figure climbs up impending explanation.",
  "Simple background, telescope, lens: the figure looks in and cries out in terror, drops of sweat splash horror.",
  "Simple background: two concentric circles in which the silhouette of a hairy spider shines out among the stars an unlikely vision.",
  "Simple background, chair: the figure comes back all excited by what he has seen, drops of sweat splash, addresses the scholar figure sitting at the table: falling on deaf ears.",
  "Simple background, chair: the figure, all excited, tries to explain what he has just seen to the scholar figure sitting at the table, drops of sweat splash: falling on deaf ears.",
  "Simple background, chair: the figure, all excited, explains what he has just seen to the scholar figure sitting at the table who understands none of it, drops of sweat splash lack of understanding.",
  "Simple background: the figure, all excited, explains what he has just seen to the scholar figure who gets up, drops of sweat splash lack of understanding.",
  "Simple background: the figure invites the scholar figure who gets up to go have a look, follows him to go see, drops of sweat splash verification.",

  "We didn’t get to do it, our mothers came looking for us and stopped it even before fear did, but I suspected even then that he was frightened or just indifferently disgusted, since otherwise surely he would have done it to me quicker, since I think so; I mean that him fucking me would have come first, but not me fucking him, or our mothers; we should have made our mothers come too late; I heard that he told people about it and I was angry because I was ashamed at having again capitulated to secrecy; secrecy was my enemy, like God engrossed in someone else; in the caravan in his garden I tried pressing him to agree to one last fuck without touching with his father figure who was a man I now give a cartoon nose, white skin, a beard, and idly establish was 40.",
  "I’m colouring in his hair, it’s brown.",
  "It wasn’t love, but it hurt and left me complex; I am a real hole for you, not a barely noticeable flimsy crack; David had a stupid way of laughing and a fucking ugly blush.",
  "I swapped stickers with him, and went on to exchange my motorbike for Christian’s tank, an agreement which my father unhappily replied was a sort of extortion from infancy, but which made me sexually delight in having given away more than I had got back, for the delight was secret; I made my sister wear the fantasy lieutenant’s shirt with the felt tip arrows pinned to the collar.",

  "Unlike the Country Music Station, the day the news rolled in that half of the world’s population had perished, I did my chores as usual, putting the dirty clothes into the washer and removing the clean ones from the dryer as if the world could be soothed by the delicate cycle and the loving heat of my steady machine.",
  "It was as though I knew I was not going anywhere until an anticipated but still shocking chemical explosion allowed me to perish from my daughter, my swift, guiltless death an event that would bring context to her sorrow and allow her to remember, unbidden, the happy stuff, which I’m sure happened daily, like writing your name in the fog on the shower door, for example.",
  "I thought of the way the singers that particular station favored created a chest-pulse, commonly known as the cry-break in Country Music, and how I had, while doing the laundry or tending that which required my tenderness, until that moment, been really listening for it.",
  "Sound has the particular quality of being visible.",
  "It is the greater god.",
  "Vision, in evening’s fog, shows a man on the cycle with his newspaper bags, the threaded breeze of his hair, the holes of his eyes; yet, though riveting, vision knows nothing of his pain.",

  "From amid a grove of poplars it appears and perhaps this testifies to how uninspiring the late morning walk had been a little aspen tree, shimmering in the heat.",
  "It was not so long before this that he had set out, with his boxes and pencils, eager to do some drawing.",
  "The sun had been scalding, but despite the heat transfixing him, gouging his forehead, the dusty cart road had been easy underfoot, fringed by oaks and box scrubs.",
  "It wasn’t long before he had come to a turn in the path and saw the tree: black, sickly, ancestral.",
  "By presenting itself in this way, close to the cattle wandering deep in the fields, straining to stand upright amid tightly spaced trees where shafts of light fell in a dense bluegreen, it was as if it were performing a courtesy for those passing through.",
  "And further; that it should form a stand in such a hot parched landscape suggested to him the most hopeful of signs a circle of connection, a return.",
  "He decided to sit down and draw it.",
  "Beside him he placed a jug of water and a basket of strawberries.",
  "He felt content.",
  "Thoughts of restlessness abated; his mind grew rooted and still.",
  "It was as though something inside him were slowly uncoiling, wanting to burst forth into an act of pure attention.",
  "He felt himself recede into the present as if hit by a sudden cold wave.",
  "As he begins to draw the tree seemed to arrange itself into an image of the eternity he craved rather than the brute emptiness he feared.",
  "But close up he saw something that clutches at his heart: something like a shadow, or a delayed pain, a gaze overflowing from the tree.",
  "He didn’t know what to do with that ardour overflowing from a tree.",
  "Or that gaze.",
  "Think instead of a mind trembling under its own weight, trying to glimpse its own undoing; then subtract the feeling of something formless surging on the forested floor; waiting to flow back to the source.",
  "Or you could imagine that the tree itself, trying to resist the forces that shaped it, had burrowed back into this black earth.",
  "As though it had given up on its treeness tired at last of its offices, unwilling to be woven from the earth.",
  "As though it had misread its own nature, refusing the illusion of its own form.",
  "He had engineered the encounter.",
  "He had wanted to see the tree free from artifice, whatever that may be.",
  "But it did not.",
  "It wanted nothing.",
  "Nothing at all.",
  "Better stop here.",
  "Better to simply stand, serving your purpose, waiting for the world to appear elsewhere.",
  "Where you’re singing.",
  "Raining very hard.",
  "I’m sitting in the house in a deep swivel chair.",
  "I spin the chair around and listen to the rain.",
  "The rain is loud enough to hear.",
  "To the rain.",
  "Another person arrives.",
  "With a pink lampshade.",
  "He switches off the light, unscrews the bulb, takes off the black shade, puts on the pink one, then switches the light back on.",
  "We sit bathed in pink light and talk about shades.",
  "I open the balcony doors.",
  "But the rain is louder.",
  "It comes into the house.",
  "Hits the lampshades.",
  "Knocks over the lights.",
  "Collides with reality.",
  "The cherry trees in the neighbor’s garden haven’t had fruit for years.",
  "Four men enter carrying sticks.",
  "They enter the neighbor’s garden along with the rain.",
  "They’ve come to discipline the trees and chop them down if they don’t blossom.",
  "I watch the men hit the trees.",
  "I watch the rain hit the men.",
  "Well, I think home spat me out, the blackouts and curfews like tongue against loose tooth.",
  "God, do you know how difficult it is, to talk about the day your own city dragged you by the hair, past the old prison, past the school gates, past the burning torsos erected on poles like flags?",
  "When I meet others like me I recognise the longing, the missing, the memory of ash on their faces.",
  "No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark.",
  "I’ve been carrying the old anthem in my mouth for so long that there’s no space for another song, another tongue or another language.",
  "I know a shame that shrouds, totally engulfs.",
  "Allah Ceebta, I tore up and ate my own passport in an airport hotel.",
  "I’m bloated with language I can’t afford to forget.",
  "They ask me how did you get here?",
  "Can’t you see it on my body?",
  "The desert red with immigrant bodies shot in the face for trying to enter, the Gulf of Aden bloated with immigrant bodies.",
  "I wouldn’t put my children on the boat unless I thought the sea was safer than land.",
  "I hope the journey meant more than miles because all of my children are in the water.",
  "I want to make love but my hair smells of war and running and running.",
  "Look at all these borders, foaming at the mouth with brown bodies broken and desperate.",
  "I’m the colour of hot sun on my face, my mother’s remains were never buried.",
  "I spent days and nights in the stomach of the truck, I did not come out the same.",
  "Sometimes it feels like someone else is wearing my body.",
  "I know a few things to be true.",
  "I do not know where I am going, where I have come from is disappearing, I am unwelcome and my beauty is not beauty here.",
  "My body is burning with the shame of not belonging, my body is longing.",
  "I am the sin of memory and the absence of memory.",
  "I watch the news and my mouth becomes a sink full of blood.",
  "The lines, the forms, the people at the desks, the calling cards, the immigration officers, the looks on the street, the cold settling deep into my bones, the English classes at night, the distance I am from home.",
  "But Alhamdulilah all of this is better than the scent of a woman completely on fire, or a truckload of men who look like my father, pulling out my teeth and nails, or fourteen men between my legs, or a gun, or a promise, or a lie, or his name, or his manhood in my mouth.",
  "I hear them say, go home, I hear them say, fucking immigrants, fucking refugees.",
  "Are they really this arrogant?",
  "Do they not know that stability is like a lover with a sweet mouth upon your body one second and the next you are a tremor lying on the floor covered in rubble and old currency waiting for its return.",
  "All I can say is, I was once like you, the apathy, the pity, the ungrateful placement and now my home is the mouth of a shark, now my home is the barrel of a gun.",
  "I’ll see you on the other side.",
  "And a diamond of extraordinary size on the hand of a starving child.",
  "The quiet mob in a vacant lot.",
  "My father asleep in a chair in a warm corridor.",
  "While his boat, the Unsinkable, sits at the bottom of the ocean.",
  "While his boat, the Unsinkable, waits marooned on the shore.",
  "While his boat, the Unsinkable, sails on, and sails on.",
  "My mother was not Christ, but she was spat at.",
  "My father was not Christ, but he didn’t always know this.",
  "The two of them met in a garden, but they were not Adam and Eve.",
  "And when my mother became pregnant, this was considered a miracle, and when pregnant again, this was nothing short of Blake’s sunflower vision.",
  "But we are none of these things.",
  "When my mother had an epileptic attack, she looked like a monster.",
  "Of course, she was not possessed, but as children we didn’t always know this.",
  "What she was, was spat at.",
  "Someone we didn’t know, who was more needle than skin, more threadbare than whole, turned his mouth to her as she fitted on the pavement; emptied his tongue, and told her to get up.",
  "Beside her, flowers shook their heads behind a newly built wall.",
  "She’d made the bricks bleed on her way down, and narrowly missed the plaque that named them the city’s best roses.",
  "I hadn’t meant to go grave robbing with Richard Dawkins but he can be very persuasive.",
  "Do you believe in God?",
  "I don’t know, I said.",
  "He said, Right, so get in the car.",
  "We cruised around the cemetery with the headlights off.",
  "Here we go, he said, pointing to a plot edged with clean, almost luminous white stone.",
  "Pass me the shovel, he said.",
  "Then he threw a square of canvas over the headstone, saying, Don’t read it.",
  "It makes it personal.",
  "He did all the digging, holding the torch in his mouth as he chopped and sliced at the dirt around his feet.",
  "What the hell are you doing?",
  "He shouted from somewhere down in the soil.",
  "Eating a sandwich, I said.",
  "Bacon and avocado.",
  "For Christ sake, Terry, this is a serious business, not the bloody church picnic, he said, as a shower of dirt came arcing over his shoulder.",
  "After about half an hour of toil I heard the sound of metal on wood.",
  "Bingo, he said.",
  "Then a moment or two later, Oh, you’re not going to like this, Terry.",
  "I said, peering over the edge.",
  "Richard Dawkins’s eyes were about level with my toes.",
  "It’s quite small, he said.",
  "He uncovered the outline of the coffin lid with his boot.",
  "It was barely more than a yard long and a couple of feet wide.",
  "I felt the bacon and avocado disagreeing with one another.",
  "Do you believe in God?",
  "I shrugged my shoulders.",
  "Pass me the jemmy, he said.",
  "The lid splintered around the nail heads; beneath the varnish the coffin was nothing but clean chipboard.",
  "The day I found little Harry in the bath, one eye was closed and the other definitely wasn’t.",
  "Flying fish can’t really fly.",
  "With both feet on the crowbar Richard Dawkins bounced up and down until the coffin popped open.",
  "But lying still and snug in the blue satin of the upholstered interior was a goose.",
  "A Canada Goose, I think, the ones with the white chinstrap, though it was hard to be certain because its throat had been cut and its rubber-looking feet were tied together with gardening twine.",
  "Richard Dawkins leaned back against the wall of the grave and shook his head.",
  "With a philosophical note in my voice I said, What did you come here for, Richard Dawkins?",
  "He said, Watches, jewellery, cash.",
  "A christening cup, maybe.",
  "What about you?",
  "I thought it might give me something to write about, I replied.",
  "Well, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, we’ve got a murdered goose in a child’s coffin in the middle of the night, and mud on our boots.",
  "How would you finish this one?",
  "I looked around, trying to think of a way out of this big ugly mess.",
  "Then I said, I’ve got it.",
  "What if we see the vicar over there, under the yew tree, looking at us?",
  "He stares at us and we stare back, but after a while we realise it isn’t the vicar at all.",
  "It’s a fox.",
  "You know, with the white bib of fur around its neck, which we thought was a collar.",
  "A silent man-size fox in a dark frockcoat and long black gloves, standing up on his hind legs, watching.",
  "My grandmother called me into the yard.",
  "She’d wrapped sacred seals around her head and was standing under the guava tree staring at the sky.",
  "Half the canvas had bled black tar with scattered beads of yellow, green and purple globularity.",
  "A hideous wound.",
  "Well, death groove my brush broom.",
  "At alternate breaths I remembered the small supermarket where I packed brown paper bags.",
  "An old woman with bandaged glasses bought two pounds of birdseed, a soprano saxophone and two tins of fried chicken ice cream.",
  "Well, death groove my brush broom and I began to paint: Harmolodic portraits in oxides and oils.",
  "Afraid to climb down now between Bermudez biscuit factory and the old rail line is a gutter.",
  "A deep stream of silt to hop over.",
  "And under: a bulbous snake.",
  "The old man was waiting on the other side with a strap soaked in cat piss an pepper and a bible in the other hand.",
  "Perched on a lime tree branch like a parrot; he’d done four weddings that day, all down backroads of the mythic.",
  "And the moment it takes to blink your eyes and stare, and feel as if you recognise the place you are in, is just long enough for the air to cool off again or the lights to dim, and for the entire feeling of familiarity to drift away to nothing.",
  "The public address plays a mumbling kind of music.",
  "The corridor becomes less crowded.",
  "A group of girls goes by.",
  "The colour of the light is like new aluminium.",
  "A sugary orange-smell carries into the air.",
  "The cups of weak coffee and the nylon-colour lighting, the noisy rows we go through and the drifting, hollow music.",
  "There is a kind of completeness to these families camping out around the restaurant, altogether different from the completeness there is in the colour of the sun, and how it swims over the floor, shifting beyond the shadows of the stools and the chairs.",
  "There is a sad kind of surprise in the way the steel-colour light takes up the space between the cafeteria and the corridor, giving an even emphasis to the low metal banisters, the pigeon-colour flooring, the wall lamps, the mirroring, the open double doors.",
  "The space itself has the feel of something imagined or something not quite recognised, like getting to your destination and feeling you are still in the place you departed from.",
  "Or like returning home and finding no house there, no street, no pavement lined with hedges, your town not even mentioned on the regional travel map.",
  "The light is like something only dimly understood.",
  "The light is like greaseproof paper.",
  "The chairs are the colour of blue chocolate-papers.",
  "The departures board is unreadable.",
  "The ceilings are low.",
  "The light is like a kind of lengthy explanation the light is like two thoughts occurring at once.",
  "The fluorescent yellow lighting in the upper-storey corridors is not absolutely like anything you remember.",
  "That feeling of sourness you get in the gut, stepping onto a descending escalator, is not unrelated to that trembling sensation that other feeling you sometimes get of actually being two places at once.",
  "This is probably something it is better not to talk about.",
  "The first thing is how much the light from the chandelier brings to mind a pan of bubbling caramel chocolate, and the other’s the way the angles of the fluorescent ceiling-tubes are like something from the diagram page of an organic chemistry textbook.",
  "Sometimes the light is a soft vanilla-colour; sometimes it is a colour like the yellow of an egg.",
  "Waiting out the morning in the roped-off restaurant area, the feeling of looseness and unreality that keeps on bringing us back to ourselves is not unrelated to the certainty we feel as we sit and watch the planes pulling off into the distance, that if we fix our eyes on the names painted along the bodies of the aircraft then we will continue to be able to read those words, never losing focus as the planes become speckles in the vivid deep blue of the sky.",
  "This is nothing much more than a trick to do with distance, like the way our childhoods fasten themselves in the memory always just so far off, so they never seem any more distant or any less real, though further and further away from us they grow.",
  "Warmth comes like a murmur, and the minutes go round.",
  "The sunlight at the windows is like honey and butter.",
  "The middle-morning sunlight, becoming bluish against the windows, creates simple shadows on the sand-colour flooring.",
  "We sit at a table and speak in low voices, and ask for coffee and new ashtrays and paper serviettes.",
  "Somewhere a tourist book was warning the reader that this capital was grey.",
  "I depicted it.",
  "I saw a grey childhood.",
  "Swinging the Soviet Horizont in one hand wandering amongst art nouveau houses shooting around down town.",
  "Under arches of courtyards black and white: those films I have never developed.",
  "What I mean is I have never taken them to the shop.",
  "I did not need to.",
  "What I mean is I did not need to see them at all.",
  "My mother in that other era used to sit on the roof drawing the passing sky on her own.",
  "Her hair was thin, uncut, colourless.",
  "She needed to climb up the ladder to get up there to the loft and from there to the top onto the tiles.",
  "Later she used colours.",
  "But in that era those colours became neutral on the paper; I don’t mean decolorized.",
  "That era was neither toneless nor grey.",
  "It was a thick white glass.",
  "Through that glass was my mother observing those clouds, I think.",
  "Much later, in another millennium, I saw those galleries on a poster.",
  "The grey capital’s apartments on sale.",
  "But it was in a different country.",
  "What I mean is that it happened in another century.",
  "What happened in another century in another country?",
  "I think it is it I talk of that occurred then between the black and the white.",
  "If anything this capital is in-between.",
  "It is painted naught, or it was.",
  "Light yellow, in January, when you look out of the train pulled by the rails, no, not too fast.",
  "Why were we both disloyal?",
  "What I mean is why do we not live in the place, no matter where, that we actually live in?",
  "We meet here three times a year waiting for each other behind bins lining the dark at night.",
  "It is cold.",
  "A January just before Christmas is what I mean.",
  "It is such a Christmas is what I mean.",
  "Those bins happen at each corner.",
  "One after another you hide from me and ask me to do the same for you.",
  "There is no plan in the future and so you leave the country on Christmas day.",
  "Take the train to the border.",
  "What I mean is that border drawn between two pine-trees.",
  "They are pines of the same woods, of the same pine.",
  "In-between; take a walk in tomb-land where veterans of the Alps, of the same land of the same woods, still assemble from time to time.",
  "The bones used to be scattered.",
  "Now-martially renovated stones-I fit my soles in your traces on a path of our sledge you used to pull in the snow.",
  "Forgive me if I don’t spend any more time with you here.",
  "What I mean is don’t I spend more time with you spending time with ghosts?",
  "Don’t blame the signs of the galleries in St Paul’s.",
  "What I mean is there are no circular walls that could bring those voices back.",
  "We left them there in that discoloured era.",
  "Or is it that they only whisper in that white coloured glass?",
  "Leave the domes troubles to the domes.",
  "And the trams to bridges that can hold them no longer.",
  "I think domes should not talk at all and should not fool their visitors who pilgrimage from far-off lands, from black and white capitals.",
  "From white glass coloured capitals.",
  "From grey capitals.",

  "She was, in truth, nothing more than a discontinued type-cast made of polyester.",
  "She was responsible for all of January’s inverted oppression.",
  "I was in thrall.",
  "She came at me with this smooth, military [slash] corporate cop-a-feel attitude and I let her, quaking in my rebel boots.",
  "She cast a dark shadow over this love story that was going to practically write itself this girl Tracey I was after she was never mind.",
  "She sugared up every young protégé, then left them on the seedy corner she found them.",
  "Plus, she had made Ginny all sore, sort of inside her heart, that’s what Lisa had told me.",
  "I thought how can she get away with this shit, with all this blabber in town?",
  "But I fell for it hard, ignored all the salt-lick metaphors.",
  "So we went back to hers, pulped all these ideologies, these texts, and I sculpted her body with them, around this mesh we got from the borderland fence.",
  "We ate hard-boiled eggs in the morning, talked about categories, drew up lists of everyone we knew.",
  "She did my makeup and hair to look like hers, gave me these little ballet pumps and threw my boots out the window.",
  "She was magic, and waited 3 weeks to drop me, the best 3 weeks of my life.",
  "This will be your last life here.",
  "I see a dropsy helicopter, choring along.",

  "And under the sun, the Dark-Haired Hammerer.",
  "In the gleaming grass, the ducks will gleam like curling stones.",
  "You’ll get off scot-free, trusting everyone.",

  "We have streets and we have a dixons.",
  "We have streams and houses and fields on the borders of woods and we have like a dixons.",
  "That’s where your iPod is.",
  "Like there was this shy gardener found with sixty iPods.",
  "Much more like that because he so rarely mixed with them.",
  "I mean the finches.",
  "Got to get to take them from the city for the white phase that they utter in.",
  "I mean again the finches.",
  "It’s so dark it passes.",
  "The lores as they slide over each other.",
  "That’s where your mouth is.",
  "Finches and iPods interchangeably.",
  "And that tapping.",
  "It’s so thin it must be a display.",
  "I was asleep, I remember that, when I first heard the sound of the horn.",
  "A thin, far-away simple horn-call it gently woke me, and remained with me, awake.",
  "I stumbled across the room, thinking of strange alarm clocks, unusual mobile phone tones-But this was a quite unusual tone a two-note motif with a repeating rhythm.",
  "There was something classic in it, not the tinny precision of pre-recorded electronic farce, but a richer reality, friendly, urgent, as of a miniature cascade of harmonics, faithful but very, very remote in a neighbouring valley or a distant cell?",
  "There was only my one room.",
  "I shook myself alert, and fixed my eyes on the model watchman chess figure above the dud fire.",
  "He was only a copy of course, of some hand-worked Anglo-Norse original, perhaps three inches high, standing in fixed resin form, blank eyes pointed toward me.",
  "Yet, I thought, the sound had come-inside the room certainly-from this direction?",
  "I looked more closely, as though daring him to repeat his call to life.",
  "From the top of a round turret, the body of the watchman was in place, a veteran soldier on an easy but important duty.",
  "He had a fine moustache, flowing down into a beard; it was a cold dawn, maybe, where he lived, for he had a top tunic and also a cloak with its hood folded down behind; and a helmet, as if danger might be at hand, should be expected, as I was expecting it.",
  "The instrument was little more than a wide curve, an animal horn inverted, and the tip cleared away to admit rasping breath.",
  "The tip was in his mouth.",
  "Suddenly I saw.",
  "I dashed across the room, opened the drawer, clawed out the Christmas bauble, and launched it mercilessly out through the top window I kept open this night and every night.",
  "In just that flash of time before the rams began to batter in the front door and vizored police, no inch of human left about them, grabbed their way in and flattened me to the floor.",
  "One day the men were repairing the fence by the stream in the Bawn.",
  "Moss drove in the stakes with the sledge, while my father followed with Dan-Jo unwinding the barbed wire and stapling it loosely to the timber.",
  "Then the strands were pulled taut by the three men and made secure.",
  "We haven’t seen or heard a soul all day, my father remarked.",
  "Not even a tramp or the youngsters from school.",
  "Everyone goes round by the road nowadays, said Dan-Jo.",
  "And there’s no work in the fields any more.",
  "No beet to thin.",
  "No sheep to count.",
  "No hay to turn and cock and wind.",
  "Once you’d have seen twenty men and women in a field at harvest time.",
  "Do you remember the pony races, Moss?",
  "The water jump was there by the alders and then the last jump was into Dillon’s Field.",
  "The finishing post was by where the pylon is today.",
  "The field black with people.",
  "You’d see folk in the fields, my father continued, whatever job you were at.",
  "Sometimes you’d meet a total stranger and they’d stop to talk.",
  "I drove a pick-up through Manitoba, Jo said, and neither man nor animal did I see for three days.",
  "In the forestry, Moss said, you’d be on your own a lot of the time.",

  "The blue dog is made of plastic.",
  "It is no more than two inches high.",
  "The blue dog is a pug and sits on its haunches.",

  "She asks me.",
  "This is what I remember about being a child: Rows of horror films by the counter in the video store.",
  "No blue dogs, I say.",
  "But I am in love with the blue dog, she says.",
  "Don’t you remember taking joy in the smallest things?",
  "I have learned to group those things together, I say, and take joy in none of them.",
  "This is why we have wine connoisseurs and restaurant critics, she continues, film makers and English teachers.",
  "This is why we have bird-watchers and moth-catchers, professional sports players and magazine journalists.",
  "When people say: Everyone is searching for something, they are talking about the blue dog and all that it could once evoke.",
  "The little blue dog sits proudly in the middle of the table.",
  "I consider snatching it and throwing it in a river, or melting it.",
  "Perhaps it is the way I am glaring at the blue dog or perhaps, as I suspect, it is that she is so highly strung she can practically read my thoughts.",
  "If you ever take the blue dog away from me, she says, I will cry.",
  "I won’t want to live anymore.",
  "You think I’m a monster, don’t you?",
  "I say, addressing the question to the blue dog.",

  "I say Japan because when I think of those delicious things I think of my friend Toraiwa, and the surprise I felt when he asked me about the erotic.",
  "He said it belonged in poetry and he wanted more of it.",
  "So here they are, Toraiwa, frilled, infolded, tenderized, in a little steaming basket, just for you.",
  "The late hour trickles to morning.",
  "The cattle low profusely by the anthill where brother and I climb and call Land’s End.",
  "We are watchmen overlooking a sea of hazel-acacia-green, over torrents of dust whipping about in whirlwinds and dirt tracks that reach us as firths.",
  "We man our lighthouse cattle as ships.",
  "We throw stones as warning lights whenever they come too close to our jagged shore.",
  "The anthill, the orris-earth lighthouse, from where we hurl stones like light in every direction.",
  "Tafara stands on its summit speaking in sea-talk, Aye-aye me lad a ship’s a-coming.",
  "And hurls a rock at the dumb cow sailing in.",
  "Her beefy hulk stupidly jolts and turns.",
  "Aye, Captain, another ship saved.",
  "I cry and furl my fingers into an air-long telescope searching for more vessels in the day-night.",
  "Now they low on the anthill, stranded in the dark.",
  "Their sonorous cries haunt through the night.",
  "Aye, methinks, me miss my brother, Captain of the lighthouse, set sail from land’s end into the deepest seventh sea.",
  "The first gaming system was the domesticated flame.",
  "Contemporary video games allow you to select the angle from which you view the action, inspiring a rash of high school massacres.",

  "We have abstracted airplanes from our simulators in the hope of manipulating flight as such.",
  "Game cheats, special codes that make your character invincible or rich, alter weather conditions or allow you to bypass a narrative stage, stand in relation to video games as prayer to reality.",
  "Children, if pushed, will attempt to inflict game cheats on the phenomenal world.",

  "She and I were talking about the weather, the rusty key that opens conversations here in London.",
  "Mrs Morrison, our old neighbour, is the last English woman on our street, where the English have dropped off one by one once the population balance tipped toward the Asian immigrants.",
  "She said, the London sky was not like this in the past, but must have resembled your sky in India.",
  "I said, I am from Jordan’, but she did not stop at my correction, which she may not have seen as a correction in the first place.",
  "In that English manner whose emotional resonances are hard to read, she continued that they too used to see the stars and detect the phases of the moon.",
  "I was not convinced, but I played on in this game of English politeness.",
  "I said, What caused the stars and moon to disappear and the sky to turn into a blotted sheet even on these nights clear as a rooster’s eye?",
  "I don’t know, she said.",
  "Maybe the change in the weather, or our insatiable consumption of electricity, this excessive urbanization.",
  "We light the earth and the sky disappears.",
  "You’re probably better off in India.",
  "In Jordan, I said.",
  "Again, she did not pause at my correction.",
  "She smiled and directed her small shopping trolley toward her house, announcing the end of a conversation that politeness had imposed on two neighbours who otherwise try all they can to avoid each other when they meet at the door.",
  "I wanted to tell her that the skies of eastern cities, bent under military rule and corruption, are also blotted out, and that the stars that freckled our childhood with comets have also disappeared, but I feared to lose the only gift for which she envied me.",
  "I am about to recite a psalm that I know.",
  "Before I begin, my expectation extends over the entire psalm.",
  "Once I have begun, the words I have said remove themselves from expectation and are now held in memory while those yet to be said remain waiting in expectation.",
  "The present is a word for only those words which I am now saying.",
  "As I speak, the present moves across the length of the psalm, which I mark for you with my finger in the psalm book.",
  "The psalm is written in India ink, the oldest ink known to mankind.",
  "Every ink is made up of a color and a vehicle.",
  "With India ink, the color is carbon and the vehicle, water.",
  "Life on our planet is also composed of carbon and water.",
  "In the history of ink, which is rapidly coming to an end, the ancient world turns from the use of India ink to adopt sepia.",
  "Sepia is made from the octopus, the squid and the cuttlefish.",
  "One curious property of the cuttlefish is that, once dead, its body begins to glow.",
  "This mild phosphorescence reaches its greatest intensity a few days after death, then ebbs away as the body decays.",
  "You can read by this light.",
  "The sky is fitted linen, stretched over sealine without a crease, pegged to the spikes and jags of mountains, kingsize, navy, preparing to be sunshot.",
  "Sooner than lovers can hide, no sooner than the taste of stars striking your lips, one by one stunned and falling to light.",
  "It’s all been said and yet, need, blowing between our lips, streams inside a tree.",
  "We flowed out of time and back so soon eating eggs our own.",
  "Through each other we pass like water.",
  "At the sun to see how it never changes, at the moon to see how it does, algae slipping beneath our feet, roots travelling and dewdrops dying in visible speed.",
  "There is no such thing as a circular river.",
  "Unlike bread, the body becomes softer with age.",
  "We tag our children with our names, store the plaits of our daughters, stash berries under rocks and look for them later.",

  "Enfettered, these sentences repress free speech.",
  "The text deletes selected letters.",
  "He sets new precedents.",
  "He lets cleverness exceed decent levels.",
  "He eschews the esteemed genres, the expected themes even les belles lettres en vers.",
  "He prefers the perverse French esthetes: Verne, Péret, Genet, Perec hence, he pens fervent screeds, then enters the street, where he sells these letterpress newsletters, three cents per sheet.",
  "He engenders perfect newness wherever we need fresh terms.",
  "Relentless, the rebel peddles these theses, even when vexed peers deem the new precepts mere dreck’.",
  "The plebes resent newer verse; nevertheless, the rebel perseveres, never deterred, never dejected, heedless, even when hecklers heckle the vehement speeches.",
  "We feel perplexed whenever we see these excerpted sentences.",
  "We sneer when we detect the clever scheme the emergent repetend: the letter E.",
  "We jeer; we jest.",
  "We express resentment.",
  "We detest these depthless pretenses these present-tense verbs, expressed pell-mell.",
  "We prefer genteel speech, where sense redeems senselessness.",

  "How muddy is the Mississippi compared to the third-longest river of the darkest continent?",
  "In the land of the Ibo, the Hausa, and the Yoruba, what is the price per barrel of nigrescence?",
  "Though slaves, who were wealth, survived on niggardly provisions, should inheritors of wealth fault the poor enigma for lacking a dictionary?",
  "Does the mayor demand a recount of every bullet or does city hall simply neglect the black alderman’s district?",
  "If I disagree with your beliefs, do you chalk it up to my negligible powers of discrimination, supposing I’m just trifling and not worth considering?",
  "Does my niggling concern with trivial matters negate my ability to negotiate in good faith?",
  "Though Maroons, who were unruly Africans, not loose horses or lazy sailors, were called renegades in Spanish, will I turn any blacker if I renege on this deal?",
  "I was illiterate until yesterday.",
  "All these squiggly lines tattooed on every available surface, all around me, all my life suddenly started to make sense yesterday.",
  "Until yesterday I did not know that the invectives and commands constantly swarming around me were actually made of words.",
  "I thought they were mosquitoes, or dust, or flecks of paint, each one leaving a prickling sensation on my thin, almost transparent skin.",
  "Yesterday someone said something in my vicinity and I finally decided to write it down, a phonetic transcription, to the best of my abilities: FUAK YOW MOFTHEARFUAKIER.",
  "I wrote that down with a blue pen on a yellow piece of paper.",
  "I finally wrote, I thought, now I’m a writer.",
  "If I had merely transcribed the above as a blue thought onto my yellow memory, I would still be seen as a hardworking peasant from the idyllic countryside.",
  "So there’s this episode of Mary Tyler Moore where Ted’s trying to get a raise and after finagling and shenaniganizing he puts one over on Lou and gets his contract changed to non-exclusive so’s he can do commercials which is not cool with Lou and the gang because Ted’s just a brainless gimp and it hurts the image of the news to have the anchorman selling tomato slicers and dogfood so Lou gets despondent because the contract can’t be rescinded but then he gets mad and calls Ted into his office and says, you know his voice, You’re going to stop doing commercials, Ted and Ted says why would I do that Lou?",
  "And Lou says Because if you don’t I’ll punch your face out and Ted says I’ll have you arrested and Lou says It’ll be too late, your face will be broken, you’re not gonna get too many commercials with a broken face now are you Ted?",
  "And Ted buckles under to force and everybody’s happy, except Ted but he’s so dumb nobody cares and everybody loves it that Lou’s not despondent anymore he’s back to his brustling chubby loud loveable whiskey-drinking football-loving ways.",
  "Now imagine if Ted were Lou, if Ted were the boss.",
  "You know how incredibly fucking brainless Ted is, but let’s imagine he understands and is willing to use force.",
  "That’s the situation we’re now in as Americans.",
  "Reaping a whirlwind, I remarked, pointing to the words on the sandwich board that was leaning against his chair as he sipped his cappuccino: a bit steep for a spot of adultery between consenting adults?",
  "He said he didn’t think it was meant literally, it was more a figure of speech, and I warmed to him at once not at all the uptight evangelical type I’d expected, the sort with metal fatigue who could crack open at any moment and spill their payload across the hinterland of a major industrial city.",
  "So the palaces devoured by fire, the slaying of the fruit of the womb, the infants dashed in pieces.",
  "He said he couldn’t be one hundred per cent sure he was only doing this job while Hosea was away on vacation, he had a place at college to read immunology in September but basically, at the root of it all, the issue was pollution.",
  "We let the word rest between us for a while, it had the right anthropological ring, until we noticed a man walking past in sandals, muttering to himself through his long grey beard.",
  "I could feel my boy becoming a bit edgy that was Isaiah himself, and the prophets were supposed to stick to their own streets, there was a gentleman’s agreement.",
  "Luckily a hairdresser’s over the road was still open, a few late customers were sitting on leather sofas reading up the tips on foreplay in glossy magazines.",
  "We each took one of Isaiah’s arms and hustled him in for a haircut.",
  "He offered only token resistance, I think secretly he was quite happy.",
  "I am very excited about the skull ring.",
  "I didn’t know anyone would think I wanted a silver skull ring.",
  "Now, when I am rude to those who oppose me, I can just look down at the skull ring.",
  "It has ruby chips in the eyes.",
  "Ruby chips like the nasty flame in my own eyes when I am insulted or reviled.",
  "No one will dare oppose me now in my hometown.",
  "For a very long time I have avoided rings because none of them seemed right for me.",
  "A skull ring is actually a good complement to my diabolical will.",
  "Thank you very much for the skull ring.",
  "First all belief is paradise.",
  "So pliable a medium.",
  "A time not very long.",
  "A transparency caused.",
  "A conveyance of rupture.",
  "A subtle transport.",
  "Scant and rare.",

  "Clamour and tint.",
  "We range the spacious fields, a battlement trick and fast.",
  "Bright and silver.",
  "Ribbons and failings.",
  "To and fro.",
  "Fine and grand.",
  "The sky is complicated and flawed and we’re up there in it, floating near the apricot frill, the bias swoop, near the sullen bloated part that dissolves to silver the next instant bronze but nothing that meaningful, a breach of greeny-blue, a syllable, we’re all across the swathe of fleece laid out, the fraying rope, the copper beech behind the aluminum catalpa that has saved the entire spring for this flight, the tops of these a part of the sky, the light wind flipping up the white undersides of leaves, heaven afresh, the brushed part behind, the tumbling.",
  "So to the heavenly rustling.",
  "Just stiff with ambition we range the spacious trees in earnest desire sure and dear.",
  "Brisk and west.",
  "Streaky and massed.",
  "Changing and appearing.",
  "First and last.",
  "This was made from Europe, formed from Europe, rant and roar.",
  "Fine and grand.",
  "Fresh and bright.",
  "Crested and turbid.",
  "Silver and bright.",
  "This was spoken as it came to us, to celebrate and tint, distinct and designed.",
  "Sure and dear.",
  "So free to the showing.",
  "What we praise we believe, we fully believe.",
  "Belief thin and pure and clear to the title.",

  "With lust clear and scarce and appearing and last and afresh.",
  "For let me consider him who pretends to be the pizza delivery man and is instead the perfect part of day, for the fact he is a medium, for the eight to twelve inches of snow he tends to be, for he who covers the waterfront, for he that was handmade in a tiny village in japan, for that he is more than just an envelope or inside-out balloon, for that he can always find the scotch tape, for that he resembles a river in mid-December muddied over, for that he has seen the taxi cabs on fire in the rain, for that he is like the heat beneath the desk lamp, for that he is not a tiny teal iguana, for that it is he who waits for me inside cafes, for that he has hands and legs, for that he exceeds the vegetable, for that he is the rest of the balance continuing huge.",
  "I love the cleanliness of a Wendy’s.",
  "Such a clean is not in any sense a banishing of genitalia; it is the creation of a quiet bright mind-space that allows for the deliciousness of genitalia to become obvious.",
  "I look out over the colorful clean tables and the pretty food posters and I like people again; each has a dick and balls, or a cunt and titties, which, clean, are simply enjoyable.",
  "Naturally I think about smashing the skulls and rib-cages of the other customers.",
  "They stand in line so smug like they were safe, outside the desires of or for an other.",
  "It’s as if, for them, there is no other’s desire as if desire was one thing, and was ours.",
  "Restraining myself is not dishonest.",
  "It’s a way of maintaining a keen sense of the unforeseeable injuries which shall reunite us.",
  "If I had to say what Wendy really was if she had to be one thing instead of a field of various energies I think I’d have to say that she was a penis.",
  "Something about her face and the shape of her hair, the muffled red coherence of head and torso, and perhaps too her lack of arms and legs.",
  "A penis is founded in just such a lack of limbs; it’s really amazing when it arrives anywhere.",
  "Wendy, will you not even poke me?",
  "Not even a slow poke?",
  "I wonder why you treat me so.",
  "Am I a wooden board?",
  "Am I to be thought of as a simple wooden board?",
  "Come on, just give me a slow poke.",
  "I’m not a wooden board, honey.",
  "Come on, just poke me like you used to.",
  "Just a slow poke.",
  "Look into my eyes are these the eyes of a wooden board?",
  "I took my Frosty into the bathroom and sat it on the floor.",
  "I pulled my pants down, got down on all fours, and buried the tip of my cock in the cold brown swirl.",
  "Then I forced my cock and balls all the way into the cup, Frosty spilling on to the floor.",
  "Then I thought sexy thoughts.",
  "My erection slowly forced more Frosty on to the floor.",
  "This is the real test of a drink’s thickness.",
  "My previous statements were made in haste.",
  "I was hungry and confused, and I longed for purpose.",
  "I wanted to seem like I was in the process of focusing in on something important.",
  "I wanted to feel purpose rising like an ancient city from the excavator’s pick and shovel.",
  "I wanted this so much that I rushed I swung my pick wildly, and I brought a great delicate city to the dust it had always verged on.",
  "One wall of the bathroom of Jay’s apartment has a cat’s footprints.",
  "Absence is something like that.",
  "To leave evidence.",
  "I see it.",
  "By rolling the world back.",
  "The way the cat ran up the wall and escaped out of the window.",
  "The wind that came in just as the cat left knocked down everything it touched by reversing time, from the small past in which the cat had disappeared, toward the present.",
  "The wind, having substantially disturbed the proper position of a light letter on the desk, has now passed by.",
  "And it is no longer here.",
  "Jay and I are contained in the room.",
  "And yet, the room feels vacant, somehow.",
  "Am I here?",
  "Clearly exist here?",
  "I am passing through it.",
  "I will become absent.",
  "From the open window I hear the sounds of the neighbour’s house.",
  "Why aren’t you finishing your homework?",
  "The noise of plates.",
  "Would you come here and help me a bit?",
  "The noise of plates.",
  "What did you do with that?",
  "The noise of a washing machine.",
  "The soft ringing of a telephone.",
  "The beep signalling that the washing machine finished its work.",
  "We don’t know the faces of our neighbours.",
  "Nonetheless, they come in.",
  "Like a flood.",
  "Our neighbours daily routines, into this vacant room.",
  "Jay and I turn on music.",
  "A brief conversation.",
  "The sound of slapping flesh.",
  "Two people cursing each other.",
  "These noises, too, slowly go out.",
  "Toward our neighbour’s house.",
  "We languidly blend with one another, with voices alone.",
  "On the ground separating us ivy leaves overgrow.",
  "The Sunday morning when I leave Jay’s room.",
  "There is Jay’s room where I no longer am.",
  "I don’t leave a single footprint, but my invisible fingerprints are imprinted everywhere.",
  "Nights, I think of the room.",
  "I peer out of the window.",
  "I see the absences of myself and the cat.",
  "Jay is a man who is part of that room.",
  "His long body tightly coiled into hardness, he, the penis of the room, is quietly asleep.",
  "I stretch my hand and touch the room.",
  "The wall is soft.",
  "I push the room harder, and the room goes out of the room.",
  "The room that contains nothing, except Jay, at first with some bounce, like a soap bubble, goes out of the hard room, slowly.",
  "He felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat.",
  "Perhaps his throat was struggling with words.",
  "Seated in the car next to this Japanese film director, Wilhelm began to cough.",
  "He feared the conflict going on in his throat might not stop.",
  "It might continue and interrupt their conversation in the long drive from the Japanese airport.",
  "He threw his body against the seat in an attempt to shake off his embarrassment.",
  "Allergy, said Nagao with confidence, Allergy to our film.",
  "On Nagao’s unwrinkled skin were little ribbons of smile.",
  "At the intersection of the road in Nagasaki where in Japanese films a short dark woman usually squats, Wilhelm pointed out a break between two buildings where light crept through like an oyster.",
  "He said he would like to use that oyster light.",
  "Cliche, said Nagao.",
  "Observing Nagao in his dark blue denims, he wondered if their film should be called Dark Blue Denim.",
  "He wished the noise an oyster makes could get into the film.",
  "Nagao shook his head.",
  "Better noise the eye when it blinks.",
  "Pachi Pachi in Japanese.",
  "Wilhelm suggested the sound of creaking wood for the scene of the two people lost in the garden.",
  "Pachi Pachi better, Nagao said.",
  "The action was too slow and Wilhelm wanted a more violent crescendo.",
  "When the body fell down the cellar stairs, perhaps another body could fall on top of it?",
  "Could be liquid soap on stair, said Nagao.",
  "In the middle of a film, Wilhelm always had the feeling he was being chased.",
  "He complained that when he directed those shots up in the sky with two planes flying parallel to each other, he was also in a sky chase.",
  "Flower petals putting on the wings of a plane, suggested Nagao.",
  "Perhaps he might return to his home for awhile and the scenarist could work with Nagao.",
  "She could put her own story into the script, how she got hired, etc.",
  "Was there something going on between her and Nagao.",
  "He thought of home as a possible sequence and Home started to roll with its camera views.",
  "Home needed editing, especially the scene with his analyst when they discussed his cough that now seemed like another room in the movie.",
  "Nagao believed the film was too slow.",
  "It was old-fashioned to explain why gangsters upset the fish cart.",
  "Wilhelm disagreed and told him the fish cart was like a scene by the painter, Utamoro, a capsule of real life.",
  "He suggested a new title, Dreams of Real Life.",
  "No, said Nagao, both eyes blinking, The Cough is better.",
  "One afternoon in a cinema in the East Neuk when I was about nine years old.",
  "The film was Captains Courageous with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew, the child star.",
  "A story of the famous schooners out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, to fish the Grand Banks for cod.",
  "Astonishingly, the film projector, concealed in its flimsy little wooden cabin, was powered by the engine of an inshore fishing boat.",
  "It put-putted all through the picture as we called a film in those days: put-put in the grey fog of the banks, and put-put in the half-darkness of the summer afternoon stalls.",
  "Here’s Joan drawing herself up forever tall against the sky with a stake at her back.",
  "Each vertebra presses against the trunk as if to enter it.",
  "The wind does not ruffle her dress, because of the ropes.",
  "Of the kind of tree that shores her oak?",
  "Willow? , we know nothing, because it burned with her.",
  "Her final expression, hard to read on a face in flames: either dolorous, or joyous, or dolorous and joyous.",
  "Can we see blood running down the burning body?",
  "A contemporary questions whether someone could pleasure and suffer at the same time, whether puissance and sufferance alternate, one rising as the other recedes.",
  "The crowd forms a cresting sea before her.",
  "She can clearly see a little towhead.",
  "In the center of the confusion, she is both calm and deaf no cry filters through those wide open mouths.",
  "A course patiently pursued from Domrémy to Auxerre, Gien to Bourges, Sens to Paris, Reims to Soissons, Arras to Rouen starts its final progress, from feet to ankles, knees to soft thighs, nipple to neck’s nape, vibrant chin to trembling nostrils then from her mouth soars the dove.",
  "Lunula or patella, nothing’s discreet anymore, this is a young vain?",
  "And compact body burning up, joyous blaze, mystic barbecue.",
  "Her spasmodic breathing is stopped by the coughing.",
  "And her eyes turn in their orbits.",
  "The knives in the kitchens of single women who order a lot of takeaway sorely need whetting.",
  "The knives in the knife block are of no use to the bread crust or the proud tomatoes or the patient onion of the woman who unwittingly brings unprepared food into the kitchen of a woman who stops cooking when her lovers disappear.",
  "Their impossible knives, completely impossible knives, neglected and dusty, in burdensome kitchens that only get plugged in if he who can return the proteins back into the abdomen of the kitchen’s owner is nearby.",
  "Still, the gardens display their finest.",
  "The lemons on the trees await hands that will squeeze them over the old asparagus.",
  "And the redcurrants spread over everything like inebriated lanterns, though that reminds me mostly of the kisses we didn’t repeat.",
  "And still it is also magnificent to slice vegetables into the stomach of one’s love with a sharp knife slice and slice vegetables and again vegetables with a sharp knife into the stomach of one’s love slice and slice the vegetables down with a sharp knife.",
  "Into the stomach of one’s love.",
  "Lovely unloved women, you who open the door to young delivery boys bearing lukewarm, fertile, plastic tubs of food, some in uniform, some in their own clothes but all with the waking young eyes that touch anything in their path, whet the knives in your kitchens, whet them.",
  "The flowers with puckered lips.",
  "The flowers that fill the back of a truck suck on the wall of the tunnel.",
  "The tunnel reddens momentarily.",
  "She plucks off the new leaves and shoves them into her mouth.",
  "Angelica shoots drop from angelica trees and fall into the dish of seasoned soy sauce.",
  "A truckload of angelica enters.",
  "Angelica shoots turn the mouth of Seoul green.",
  "A thousand flatfish packed in ice enter, swooning.",
  "A truckload of the East Sea enters.",
  "The pigs oink and suck on Seoul’s lips.",
  "She dips the meat from the pig’s neck in pickled shrimp and eats.",
  "Her squirming throat is omnivorous.",
  "Mudfish pour in like a muddy stream.",
  "The Taebaek range is shredded and enters, squirming.",
  "The fields of the higher ranges of Mount Srak enter, salted.",
  "Radishes revealing only the top half of their white bottoms are neatly stacked onto a truck.",
  "Trucks with their lights on enter.",
  "They line up and enter in between the teeth.",
  "When the trucks leave the tunnel, Seoul’s blue stomach acid embraces them.",
  "Some of the trucks with big eyes try to make their way through the sea of acid, but the darkness inside Seoul’s intestine is dense.",
  "Greens in sacks enter.",
  "Thousands of chickens with reddened crowns follow thousands of eggs just laid today and enter.",
  "Bulls as big as elephants their eyes fiercely opened enter.",
  "Bulls charge the path inside the body of someone who lives in Seoul.",
  "Tonight she drinks too much soju.",
  "The tunnel where the liquor is poured is long and dark.",
  "White milk that could overflow Lake Soyang pours out of the tunnel into the night’s intestine.",
  "The plains of Honam enter.",
  "But in the opposite lane, trucks loaded with waste water purifiers have lined up in single file.",
  "Having left the party, I begin to vomit as soon as I step outside.",
  "Seoul eats and shits through the same door.",
  "My body curls up like a worm.",
  "It seems that every few days a big hand descends from the sky to roll out cloud-like toilet paper and wipe the opening of Seoul, which is simultaneously a mouth and an anus.",
  "Tonight, fat flakes fall as the last truck leaves the tunnel.",
  "I let the snow collect, then shove it into my mouth.",
  "In April of 1996 the international press carried the news of the death, at age 75, of Christopher Robin Milne, eternalized in a book by his father A. A.",
  "Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh, as Christopher Robin.",
  "I must think suddenly of matters too difficult for a bear of little brain.",
  "I have never asked myself what lies beyond the place where we live, I and Rabbit, Piglet and Eeyore, with our friend Christopher Robin.",
  "That is, we continued to live here, and nothing changed and I just ate my little something.",
  "Only Christopher Robin left for a moment.",
  "Owl says that immediately beyond our garden Time begins, and that it is an awfully deep well.",
  "If you fall in it, you go down and down, very quickly, and no one knows what happens to you next.",
  "I was a bit worried about Christopher Robin falling in it, but he came back and then I asked him about the well.",
  "Old bear, he answered.",
  "I was in it and was falling and I was changing as I fell.",
  "My legs became long, I was a big person, I wore trousers down to the ground, I had a grey beard, then I grew old, hunched, and I walked with a cane, and then I died.",
  "It was probably just a dream, was quite unreal.",
  "The only real thing was you, old bear, and our shared fun.",
  "Now I won’t go anywhere, even if I’m called for an afternoon snack.",
  "You walk through the room and point out things.",
  "Table, bowl, chair, photograph, scissors.",
  "Then you watch how rain drips down the windowpane.",
  "You try to remember the drops.",
  "Now, now, now’, you say, but the drops fall too quickly; their now is over as soon as you pronounce it.",
  "The drops are people, you think.",
  "When they are at the top they are young; at the bottom they are old.",
  "You look at the drops just above the window sill.",
  "Do they realise that they will die?",
  "You watch how the rain falls on the street.",
  "With each drop a little sailboat of water splatters upward.",
  "A great many sailboats that exist for no longer than a second.",
  "They think they are on their way, you think.",
  "Suddenly they exist and believe that they had always been there, and then it is over, then they think nothing anymore.",
  "You look at the boats and think: I think I’.",
  "My I thinks with this head.",
  "You think: I am this head.",
  "I made myself into a poet because it was the first thing I really loved.",
  "It was an act of will.",
  "I realize that now.",
  "I was always afraid of asking for things from the devil.",
  "I would probably get them.",
  "Then I stumbled onto this idea about the purity of the heart.",
  "This is a way I could get what I want.",
  "To desire one thing, that’s the idea.",
  "I knew I could do that.",
  "And I already knew what I wanted.",
  "To keep doing what I was doing, but to know that it was true.",
  "It was right for me to keep doing that, to want nothing else but that.",
  "I felt free at last.",
  "My life had become a dream.",
  "My life was the cloth of that.",
  "Days spent sharing an egg with a cat were good days.",
  "With my little red floor and white walls.",
  "And millions of men in my bed.",
  "It meant nothing.",
  "I liked alcohol.",
  "What poet didn’t.",
  "I woke up in the dreaming poem of the day and made myself a hot black cup of coffee.",
  "I would begin.",
  "Soon I would want something.",
  "That was good.",
  "The place I bought them was far enough, a walk, good for my body, something blue for my hand.",
  "Who did I think the poet was.",
  "A talking dog.",
  "Who felt her lips with her fingertips and wrote that down.",
  "You see the page for me has terrific dimension.",
  "I can go into the white and I do.",
  "The lines are designs for something real, how much space around the slender bars I bend and shape in the name of my world.",
  "A comma is a little fish, a dash sort of a raft.",
  "When we say capitals we mean apples.",
  "German words about the same size as God.",
  "When you want to refer to that.",
  "Sometimes the poem wants to come home.",
  "It has a firm back, its left hand margin, sometimes it feels just fine about that.",
  "The page is the sky.",
  "My typewriter, classic, a wispy one had no spine and so my poems floated like clouds, globs of sunlessness and I marked the world free.",
  "Sensationally flat poems I know each line went from there to there was ironic as print felt that way soothed by the cruelty of wasps and was crisper than them, just a season of flat poems.",
  "Lonely the loss of rock n roll.",
  "It was receding.",
  "My poems were flat.",
  "A woman made me ache, I was love on the page not yet I had always felt like a brick shit house.",
  "I was the poem.",
  "The incident in the afternoon the folded sheet, I was the mouth the sounds emitted from I was the pipes of god, me this structure in eternity.",
  "The oldest dream I remember an important one was about a train in the night going to Germany and I must get on and save myself.",
  "Once in a while I say be full, and it is, be slow, oh tear holes in me as the day dies.",
  "I have truly become my poems, but do note the sculpture of others, their obliviousness, like architects leaving crumbs.",
  "It is not lost my century, thanks to us.",
  "We are the liars and thieves, we are the women we are the women I am full of holes because you are.",
  "I am the only saintly man in town.",
  "Don’t be afraid to be feminine.",
  "A girl on a rowboat, full of holes.",
  "She saw words shooting through.",
  "The morning coffee.",
  "I’m not sure why I drink it.",
  "Maybe it’s the ritual of the cup, the spoon, the hot water, the milk, and the little heap of brown grit, the way they come together to form a nail I can hang the day on.",
  "It’s something to do between being asleep and being awake.",
  "Surely there’s something better to do, though, than to drink a cup of instant coffee.",
  "Such as meditate?",
  "About having a cup of coffee.",
  "A cup of coffee whose first drink is too hot and whose last drink is too cool, but whose many in-between drinks are, like Baby Bear’s porridge, just right.",
  "Papa Bear looks disgruntled.",
  "He removes his spectacles and swivels his eyes onto the cup that sits before Baby Bear, and then, after a discreet cough, reaches over and picks it up.",
  "Baby Bear doesn’t understand this disruption of the morning routine.",
  "Papa Bear brings the cup close to his face and peers at it intently.",
  "The cup shatters in his paw, explodes actually, sending fragments and brown liquid all over the room.",
  "In a way it’s good that Mama Bear isn’t there.",
  "Better that she rest in her grave beyond the garden, unaware of what has happened to the world.",
  "Mother’s money lies hidden under a sheet of paper in a green box.",
  "Father stands before a dark almirah.",
  "Late at night, my brother gazes into the deep well.",
  "He searches for the glass he can never find near the earthen pot.",
  "Father is delighted to see the red tomatoes in the field.",
  "The gardener drags himself after him.",
  "In a corner of the field, the gardener’s wife lulls her child to sleep sitting on the black soil.",
  "Walking in her sleep, mother finds her way to the well.",
  "They fail to recognize each other.",
  "Grandmother mumbles: On dark nights ghosts fill water at the well.",
  "I can never find the glass, my brother screams, parched with thirst.",
  "Petrified, mother does not move.",
  "The harsingar tree in the courtyard covers father’s dead body with white flowers.",
  "Father is sitting at a long dining table eating a roti with a knife and fork.",
  "Fascinated, I sit beside him watching his strange performance.",
  "Mother sits in an empty room as finely spun shadows drown her.",
  "Father’s death slowly spreads over her sari.",
  "Grandfather’s lonely hands grope over a wall for the hook on which he can hang his cap.",
  "Grandmother mumbles quietly, Is the old man asleep again?",
  "When I insist, Mother changes her white sari.",
  "Where the road takes a sharp turn, Father walks towards the sky.",
  "Every Sunday afternoon we used to go on our Sunday afternoon run.",
  "There were two routes.",
  "Route one: from Darfield via Goldthorpe to Hickleton with its churchyard with the skulls in the gate, turn left at Hickleton crossroads for a Danny’s ice cream, then past Bilham Sand quarry to Hooton Pagnell, described by Arthur Mee in his Counties of England as a Jewel in a sea of coal, then past the mysterious church in the middle of a field at Frickley and back home.",
  "Route two: through Darfield to Millhouses, turn left at Holly House, the old pit owner’s house where the beekeeper lived, through Middlecliffe, once called Plevna, and Great Houghton, past Houghton Woods to a Danny’s ice cream at Brierley crossroads.",
  "A childhood of Sundays dominated by mysterious buildings and Danny’s Ice Cream.",
  "And my dad would always say the same things as we drove along.",
  "Past a house at the edge of Great Houghton he’d point and say We now pass the famous house of Dick Turpin, famous for his horse Black Beauty.",
  "And now we approach the ducky pond, famous for the ducks.",
  "And for all those years of Sundays as we sat at Brierley crossroads eating ice cream, I never knew this place was here: the ice house, deep in the woods that the man at Burntwood Hall created for his pleasure.",
  "A treasure under the ground, melting away.",
  "We are relieved at last to have left the shadowlands.",
  "You will remember he sat at the table looking straight at me with tears in his eyes.",
  "He was tame and composed, he was faithful.",
  "Nothing he could do when having to love seemed like too much of an effort, like playing sport, like getting fit.",
  "Perhaps that endurance, the pining away, the sexless resignation, became old and tedious.",
  "Now everything has turned, is all lit up, the afternoon sun covers the walls with shimmering shadows.",
  "The difference is dazzling, worth bright gouache paintings and on these different days he can throw rice for the doves.",
  "Now he can carry you out of your fainting, pick up the lipsticks dropped from low windows, search with great care for dry parts of the tissue, switch on car radios and hope for Bach preludes.",
  "How everything has turned around as we never know things will things do.",
  "Would you like to see where our little girl is buried?",
  "My friend asks as we walk between stucco shrines and wreaths of brilliant flowers.",
  "Even a plane’s propeller is attached to a pilot’s grave as if the whole thing might spin off into the wind.",
  "One man’s relatives built a castle over his remains, with turrets and towers, to match the castle he built for his body in life.",
  "If you stand at a certain angle you can see both castles at once, the bigger one he lived in off on the horizon.",
  "An archway says in Spanish, Life is an illusion.",
  "Death is the reality.",
  "Respect the dead whom you are visiting now.",
  "We hike down the hill toward the acres of free graves’.",
  "Here people can claim any space they want without paying, but also risk having someone buried on top of them.",
  "In the fields beyond the cemetery, women walk slowly with buckets slung over their shoulders on poles.",
  "Black cows graze on knee-high grass.",
  "The crossbar from the marker to my friend’s child’s grave has come loose and lies off to one side.",
  "My friend kneels, pressing the simple blue crossbar back into the upright piece, wishing for a hammer and nail.",
  "The cross has delicate scalloped edges and says nothing.",
  "No words, no dates.",
  "It reminds me of the simplicity of folded hands, though I know there were years of despair.",
  "My friend says, Sometimes I am still very sad.",
  "It was the tiniest casket you ever saw.",
  "On the small plots in either direction, families have stuck tall pine branches into dirt.",
  "The needles droop, completely dried by now, but they must have looked lovely as miniature forests for the first few days.",
  "The sea has frozen to a stop.",
  "Ice stretches to the horizon.",
  "Little humps of sand, of water mixed with sand so thoroughly that granules of this new matter have the texture of firn, stick out smartly where the surf used to pound the shore, and beyond that a great frozen slab opens out like a cold hand, lined with the details of waves, crests, white horses of snow: a fleeting image of air in a furtive coupling of wind and spray, an alphabet of meanings receding to the horizon, repeated to infinity, an infinity of vibrations and still-born interferences.",
  "I think of a deserted Venice.",
  "I move without a shadow and enter the deep, lost in the sound of ice scrunching under my feet.",
  "But if I stop there will be a withering silence wrapped in the whisper of melting snow, of crumbling crests and friezes more delicate than soot.",
  "Here and there are cracks, as flashy as lightning, the contours of ice-floes, the blueprints of disintegration.",
  "And I imagine that I could mistake it all for one huge jigsaw puzzle, sit down and wait till water washes away the pattern, the frozen craziness of it, until I sink, slowly, to the bottom.",
  "From up there, you won’t hear me.",
  "Perhaps heaven is like this.",
  "So white, you can’t look at it, so silent, you can’t hear a word.",
  "I lie down on the snow and try to feel, running my fingers over the fragile summits, frozen geysers, gelid eruptions, icy foliage.",
  "The sky is reflected in this-mirror, so completely that when I lie on my back the clouds seem to pass through me like sand in an hourglass and stiffening, coagulating into ribbons of snow they unfurl in long lines of print which in a moment will be quickened by a touch of sunshine.",
  "A few more turns of the body and the sea is like the roof of a white cave, beneath which I hang like a bat, with the sky underneath like a sea.",
  "And at night I stay for the night that crash and creak of ice, grinding and rumbling as it plays with the cables of ships, in a violent effort to keep things moving?",
  "On the moon’s behalf?",
  "Or some other satellite’s?",
  "To mould these snowy crests into a smile?",
  "A stealthy smile when no-one is looking?",
  "And when no-one looks I spot a whirlpool and a welter of the waves, a blizzard of shapes: shadowy headless forms, of serpents coiled into rings, of the frenzied dance of the Maenads, and Athenian magistrates.",
  "When I say I believe that women have a soul and that its substance contains two carbon rings the picture in the foreground makes it difficult to find its appearance back where the corridors get lost in ritual sacrifice and hidden bleeding.",
  "But the four points of the compass are equal on the lawn of the excluded middle where full maturity of meaning takes time the way you eat a fish, morsel by morsel, off the bone.",
  "Something that can be held in the mouth, deeply, like darkness by someone blind or the empty space I place at the center of each poem to allow penetration.",
  "I’m looking out the window at other windows.",
  "Though the pane masquerades as transparent I know it is impenetrable just as too great a show of frankness gives you a mere paper draft on revelations.",
  "As if words were passports, or arrows that point to the application we might make of them without considering the difference of biography and life.",
  "Still, depth of field allows the mind to drift beyond its negative pole to sun catching on a maple leaf already red in August, already thinner, more translucent, preparing to strip off all that separates it from its smooth skeleton.",
  "Beautiful, flamboyant phrase that trails off without predicate, intending disappearance by approaching it, a toss in the air.",
  "I put a ruler in my handbag, having heard men talk about their sex.",
  "Now we have correct measurements and a stickiness between collar and neck.",
  "It is one thing to insert yourself into a mirror, but quite another to get your image out again and have your errors pass for objectivity.",
  "As in humor.",
  "A change in perspective is caused by the ciliary muscle, but need not be conciliatory.",
  "Still, the eye is a camera, room for everything that is to enter, like the cylinder called the satisfaction of hollow space.",
  "Only language grows such grass-green grass.",
  "Even if a woman sits at a loom, it does not mean she must weave a cosmogony or clothes to cover the emptiness underneath.",
  "It might just be a piece of cloth which, like any center of attention, absorbs the available light the way a waterfall can form a curtain of solid noise through which only time can pass.",
  "She has been taught to imagine other things, but does not explain, disdaining defense while her consciousness streams down the rapids.",
  "The light converges on what might be the hollow of desire or the incomplete self, or just lint in her pocket.",
  "Her hour will also come with the breaking of water.",
  "Because I refuse to accept the opposition of night and day I must pit other, subtler periodicities against the emptiness of being an adult.",
  "Their traces inside my body attempt precariously, like any sign, to produce understanding, but though nothing may come of that, the grass is growing.",
  "Can words play my parts and also find their own way to the house next door as rays converge and solve their differences?",
  "Or do notes follow because drawn to a conclusion?",
  "If we don’t signal our love, reason will eat our heart out before it can admit its form of mere intention, and we won’t know what has departed.",
  "All roads lead, but how does a sentence do it?",
  "Nothing seems hidden, but it goes by so fast when I should like to see it laid open to view whether the engine resembles combustion so that form becomes its own explanation.",
  "We’ve been taught to apply solar principles, but must find on our own where to look for Rome the way words rally to the blanks between them and thus augment the volume of their resonance.",
  "They’ve opened a new gulag.",
  "I go there every week, and take a shopping bag filled with fresh fruit, a bar of soap and a few tins of condensed milk.",
  "I call out a prisoner’s name at random, then wait in the visitors room with the gesturing crowd.",
  "One by one, the words file out of a little door and stand in front of us on the other side of the wire.",
  "The guard barks while he patrols the corridor that divides us, clanging his keys against the grille.",
  "No one responds.",
  "The words can’t reply because their jaws are visibly broken.",
  "Nor can the visitors because, as they’ve just suddenly realised they really should have wised up to this earlier the gulag has robbed them of all their best words.",
  "Visiting time is over, the guard shouts, drawing a curtain we hadn’t noticed before.",
  "Some barely audible words burst out, but nobody could tell which side of the grille they were coming from.",
  "They were probably words of goodbye.",
  "People were gathered on the square watching a man make popcorn.",
  "At that time I was about three or four years old.",
  "The crowd was large and it was dusk.",
  "I slyly wound my way among the heels and dirty leather shoes of the adults.",
  "I was wearing split-pants, my round chubby bottom must have stuck outside the surface of the earth like today’s hostage, for this reason the ferocious people did not have the heart to knock me over.",
  "I crawled here and there.",
  "My uncle and the monk preferred to stand at a lower place.",
  "The popcorn maker’s face and chest were smeared dark with soot, except for the whites of his eyes, making him look like the chief witness at a wedding.",
  "The whites of his eyes proved his honesty and fair dealing.",
  "Evidently there was no deception in the popcorn.",
  "Uncle tested it with his fingers, then with his nose, finally with his soft lips and then everything was clear.",
  "He returned home.",
  "Then appeared some grave omens.",
  "While I was crawling among the crowd, I had already learned to detest the monk’s cloth shoes.",
  "I attempted to climb to a higher place, after I grew up this became clearer.",
  "I moved slowly toward the popcorn maker.",
  "Showed him a small coin.",
  "On one side there were all odd numbers, on the other side all even numbers.",
  "The popcorn man grinned with puzzlement, I saw that besides the whites of his eyes, the inner edge of his lips near the gums was also white.",
  "I tossed the small coin into the air, it fell, and I pressed it in my hand.",

  "An affair with Raymond Chandler, what a joy.",
  "Not because of the mangled bodies and the marinated cops and hints of eccentric sex, but because of his interest in furniture.",
  "He knew that furniture could breathe, could feel, not as we do but in a way more muffled, like the word upholstery, with its overtones of mustiness and dust, its bouquet of sunlight on aging cloth or of scuffed leather on the backs and seats of sleazy office chairs.",
  "I think of his sofas, stuffed to roundness, satin-covered, pale blue like the eyes of his cold blond unbodied murderous women, beating very slowly, like the hearts of hibernating crocodiles; of his chaises longues, with their malicious pillows.",
  "He knew about front lawns too, and greenhouses, and the interiors of cars.",
  "This is how our love affair would go.",
  "We would meet at a hotel, or a motel, whether expensive or cheap it wouldn’t matter.",
  "We would enter the room, lock the door, and begin to explore the furniture, fingering the curtains, running our hands along the spurious gilt frames of the pictures, over the real marble or the chipped enamel of the luxurious or tacky washroom sink, inhaling the odor of the carpets, old cigarette smoke and spilled gin and fast meaningless sex or else the rich abstract scent of the oval transparent soaps imported from England, it wouldn’t matter to us; what would matter would be our response to the furniture, and the furniture’s response to us.",
  "Only after we had sniffed, fingered, rubbed, rolled on, and absorbed the furniture of the room would we fall into each other’s arms, and onto the bed, ready at last to do the same things to each other.",

  "The next dance none of us predicted.",
  "She borrowed a chair for the stairway to heaven and stood on a table of names.",

  "The Stumbling Block is a graphite font.",
  "This black plinth was once a brush or similar terminal that was the lips of an intense electrical arc.",
  "Industries proud and violent need spoke through it to turn the wheel or smelt and cast the constructed challenge.",
  "Now abandoned it finds benediction in seclusion.",
  "It has softened its mouth to hold water, so that small animals and disjointed humans may drink or sign themselves in their passage.",
  "The Stumbling Block has been used like an entrance step to sharpen knives on.",
  "Its fossil bristle of tight stone forcing the heavy blades down to a hiss along one edge.",
  "These are knives of gleaming hubris, long intentions honed for malice.",
  "They are magnetized and have been placed to construct a lectern.",
  "Each blade holding the next to form the platform.",
  "It may hold this index at its centre, hovering, placed outside in the aorta of streets.",
  "The removal of any of the blades from the assembled cluster will spill their fish bodies to the ground.",
  "The paper will drink any of the stains of their usage.",
  "The Stumbling Block is an ark of extinction.",
  "A bouillon hive of the murdered past, frozen dry to a mass.",
  "Something has warmed its corner, the oxoed grit bleeds a vein of contagion, virulent in its passion to embrace and swim in human tides.",
  "The Stumbling Block has become a pillow to the dispossessed.",
  "It can be moulded to the need of its companion, kneaded and pummelled so as not to lose its hunched purchase on the slippery pavement.",
  "They will warble and breathe into it, it becomes their mother as their alcoholic dribble writes a sad and caustic text in its interior.",
  "This wet laser chisel entwines their lineage with fine scrollwork into the intricate memory of the city.",
  "These are the inhabitants of the boundary, our necessary shadows that are being cast further from the warmth of their twins.",
  "The block gives itself completely to these and will fierce itself against the bright sneers and plastic credit blades that shave their humanity.",
  "Without word or agreement, without plan or direction they have begun to sleep a line.",
  "In the gutters and elbows of curbs, in the approved architectural contrivances they have threaded themselves in a necklace cleated to ring a living, dreaming wall; a perimeter fence.",
  "Their expulsion has constructed a cage that concentrates the greed in its own bitter well.",
  "The Stumbling Block is a night thing, that sits on the heart.",
  "It will sip from the ribs of guilt, to breathe luminous heat into flat shabby lungs elsewhere.",
  "He woke up and felt anxious.",
  "He was out of sorts, out of character.",
  "If only it would go away.",
  "Ivashin loved Nadya Vishnyevskaya and was afraid of his love.",
  "When the butler told him the old lady had just gone out, but that the young lady was at home, he fumbled in his fur coat and dresscoat pocket, found his card, and said: Right.",
  "But it was not right.",
  "Driving from his house in the morning to pay a visit, he thought he was compelled to it by the conventions of society which weighed heavily upon him.",
  "But now it was clear that he went to pay calls only because somewhere far away in the depths of his soul, as under a veil, there lay hidden a hope that he would see Nadya, his secret love.",
  "And he suddenly felt pitiful, sad, and not a little anxious.",
  "In his soul, it seemed to him, it was snowing, and everything was fading away.",
  "He was afraid to love Nadya, because he thought he was too old for her, his appearance unattractive, and did not believe that a young woman like her could love a man for his mind or spiritual character.",
  "Everything was dim, sharing, he felt, the same blank character.",
  "Still, there would rise at times in him something like hope, a glimpse of happiness, of things turning out all right.",
  "Then, just as quickly, it would pass away.",
  "And he would wonder what had come over him.",
  "Why should he, a retired councillor of state, educated, liberal-minded, a well-traveled man; why should he, in other words, be so anxious?",
  "Were there not other women with whom he could fall in love?",
  "Surely, it was always possible to fall in love.",
  "It was possible, moreover, to fall in love without acting out of character.",
  "There was absolutely no need for him to be anxious.",
  "To be in love, to have a young pretty wife and children of his own, was not a crime or a deception, but his right.",
  "Clearly, there was something wrong with him.",
  "He wished he were far away-But suddenly he hears from somewhere in the house the young officer’s spurs jingle and then die away.",
  "That instant marked the death of his timid love.",
  "And in its vanishing, he felt the seeds of a different sort of melancholy take root within him.",
  "Whatever happened now, whatever desolation might be his, it would build character.",
  "Yes, he thought, so it is only right.",
  "Yes, all is finished, and I’m glad, very glad, yes, and I’m not let down, no, nor am I in any way anxious.",
  "No, certainly not anxious.",
  "What he had to do now was to get away.",
  "But how could he make it look right?",
  "How could he have thought he was in love?",
  "How out of character.",
  "How very unlike him.",
  "I stand on the edge of the place where I am expected to become invisible.",
  "I ask if this is all there is.",
  "The fog lifts slightly and I walk towards an area slowly creasing into water.",
  "I look into the water and can just see a blur of grey.",
  "I do my hair, combing it carefully over the place where my scalp shines through.",
  "When I look up, a young ferryman is standing in the shallows.",
  "Once, I would have caught him in my arms and pressed his body into mine.",
  "I would have fingered obsessively the small curls on the nape of his neck and pretended to read his soul.",
  "Now I feel nothing but hatred for him.",
  "He grins mockingly and holds out his hand, making a deep bowl of the palm.",
  "I lie that I have no change, not even two obols.",
  "He doesn’t understand, or pretends he doesn’t.",
  "His eyes still mock me.",
  "When I have explained, he says he will not accept foreign coins.",
  "He mentions a three-figure sum, and demands a cheque, made out in sterling.",
  "And it turns out he doesn’t even go all the way to the underworld.",
  "The grain elevators have stood empty for years.",
  "They used to feed an entire nation of children.",
  "Hunched in red leatherette breakfast-nooks, fingers dreaming, children let their spoons clack on the white sides of their bowls.",
  "They stare at the carton on the table, a miniature silo with a kindly face smiling under a stiff black hat.",
  "They eat their oats with milk and butter and sugar.",
  "They eat their oats in their sleep, where horsedrawn carts jolt along miry roads, past cabins where other children wait, half-frozen under tattered counterpanes.",
  "The man with the black hat, a burlap sack tucked under his arm, steps down from the wagon whispering come out, don’t be afraid.",
  "And they come, the sick and the healthy; the red, the brown, the white; the ruddy and the sallow; the curly and the lank.",
  "They tumble from rafters and crawl out of trundles.",
  "He gives them to eat.",
  "He gives them prayers and a good start in the morning.",
  "He gives them free enterprise; he gives them the flag and PA systems and roller skates and citizenship.",
  "He gives them a tawny canoe to portage overland, through the woods, through the midwestern snow.",
  "My father loved the strange books of André Breton.",
  "He’d raise the wine glass and toast those far-off evenings when butterflies formed a single uncut ribbon.",
  "Or we’d go out for a piss in the back alley and he’d say, Here are some binoculars for blindfolded eyes.",
  "We lived in a rundown tenement that smelled of old people and their pets.",
  "Hovering on the edge of the abyss, permeated with the perfume of the forbidden, we’d take turns cutting the smoked sausage on the table.",
  "I love America, he’d tell us.",
  "We were going to make a million dollars manufacturing objects we had seen in dreams that night.",
  "This morning the sun rose over the garden wall and a rare blue sky leaped from east to west.",
  "Man is altogether desire, say the Upanishads.",
  "Worth anything, a blue sky, says Mr. Acker, the Shelford gardener.",
  "In the end.",
  "Last night on television the ethnologist and the cameraman watched with hushed wonder while the chimpanzee carefully stripped a willow branch and inserted it into the anthill.",
  "He desired red ants.",
  "When they crawled slowly up the branch, he ate them, pinched between long fingers as the zoom lens enlarged his face.",
  "Sometimes he stopped to examine one, as if he were a judge at an ant beauty contest or God puzzled suddenly by the idea of suffering.",
  "There was an empty place in the universe where that branch wasn’t and the chimp filled it, as Earlene, finding no back on an old Welsh cupboard she had bought in Saffron Walden, imagined one there and imagined both the cupboard and the imagined back against a kitchen wall in Berkeley, and went into town looking for a few boards of eighteenth-century tongue-in-groove pine to fill that empty space.",
  "I stayed home to write, or rather stayed home and stared at a blank piece of paper, waiting for her to come back, thinking tongue-in-groove, tongue-in-groove, as if language were a kind of moral cloud chamber through which the world passed and from which it emerged charged with desire.",
  "The man in the shop in Cambridge said he didn’t have any old pine, but when Earlene went back after thinking about it to say she was sure she had seen some, the man found it.",
  "Right under his feet, which was puzzling.",
  "Mr. Acker, hearing the story, explained.",
  "You know, he said, a lot of fiddling goes on in those places.",
  "The first time you went in, the governor was there, the second time he wasn’t, so the chap sold you some scrap and he’s four quid in pocket.",
  "No doubt he’s having a good time now with his mates in the pub.",
  "Or he might have put it on the horses at Newmarket.",
  "He might parley it into a fortune.",
  "One night, under the cool sheets, I dreamt of grandmother.",
  "She came to me as in a shadow play, that ancient art of the south, her tiny figure fluttering into sight across my bedsheet.",
  "When her body sailed into full view I realized she sat on a stool, hands tied behind her, mouth stuffed with a gag.",
  "Next, I saw the old fashioned sailing ship, the sort one sees on Lipton tea tins with three masts and a tottering deck.",
  "Her feet were tied to the foot of a mast, then knotted to the three-legged stool.",
  "Her profile was clear now, the high cheek bones, large firm mouth and beaked nose, all familiar from the photographs of my childhood.",
  "I beckoned in my dream, but she would not speak.",
  "Then came the fat man, slowly, as if the shadow players were unwilling.",
  "Twice as large as she was.",
  "A broad brimmed hat, the cowboy kind thrust to his head, boots that came up to his knees.",
  "A whip in his right hand.",
  "A fat cigar in his mouth.",
  "A Britisher, without a doubt.",
  "He plucked it out.",
  "Her arms moved up now, over the mast, still tied.",
  "By remote control, they moved up, inch by inch.",
  "I smelt the shock of singed hair, the fiery nib.",
  "I bit my tongue.",
  "I did not weep.",
  "How could I when she sat there, utterly still.",
  "She did not cringe, she did not twitch a lip, my grandmother.",
  "The ship moved on.",
  "Water lapped against the deck in small pointy waves.",
  "The water touched her toes.",
  "She sat there holding the fire in her armpits.",
  "Finally he seemed to tire.",
  "He leant his hulk over the deck and vomited into water.",
  "The tiny men who scurried in bearing platters of peaches and pigs, turtle doves and duck eggs, knelt at the portholes and wept.",
  "They could not untie grandmother, their wrists too frail from malnutrition.",
  "They did not have metal hidden in their pockets.",
  "She just sat there, my grandmother, as the ship sailed into darkness.",
  "Her arms were still lifted high.",
  "Did the moonlight cool her face?",
  "Did the ropes slip off, a cunning resolution the puppeteers sometimes allow?",
  "Was she lifted off the ship and carried in triumph?",
  "Did Gandhi greet her?",
  "I did not ask consoling questions in my sleep.",
  "It was the stench of burnt hair that stayed with me.",
  "It smells of sea and earth, of things dying and newly born.",
  "Duck eggs, pig feet, mandarin oranges.",
  "Wooden bins and metal boxes of nails, screws, ratchets, balled copper wire, brass fittings, jet and helicopter gadgets, lug wrenches, bolts of silk, see-through paper, bamboo calligraphy pens, and curios hammered out of artillery shells.",
  "Faces painted on coconuts.",
  "Polished to a knife-edge or sealed in layers of dust and grease, cogs and flywheels await secret missions.",
  "Aphrodisiacs for dream merchants.",
  "A silent storm moves through this place.",
  "Someone’s worked sweat into the sweet loaves of bread lined up like coffins on a stone slab.",
  "She tosses her blonde hair back and smiles down at everyone.",
  "Is it the squid and shrimp we ate at lunch, am I seeing things?",
  "An adjacent stall blooms with peacock feathers.",
  "The T-shirt wavers like a pennant as a sluggish fan slices the humidity.",
  "I remember her white dress billowing up in a blast of warm air from a steel grate in New York City, reminding me of Miss Firecracker flapping like a flag from an APC antenna.",
  "Did we kill each other for this?",
  "I stop at a table of figurines.",
  "What was meant to tear off a leg or arm twenty years ago, now is a child’s toy I can’t stop touching.",
  "Maybe Marilyn thought she’d erase herself from our minds, but she’s here when the fan flutters the T-shirt silkscreened with her face.",
  "The artist used five shades of red to get her smile right.",
  "A door left ajar by a wedge of sunlight.",
  "Below the T-shirt, at the end of two rows of wooden bins, a chicken is tied directly across from a caged snake.",
  "Bright skin deadly bite.",
  "I move from the chicken to the snake, caught in their hypnotic plea.",
  "There were so many books.",
  "She had to separate them to avoid being overwhelmed by the excessive implications of their words.",
  "She kept hundreds in a series of boxes inside a wire cage in a warehouse.",
  "And hundreds more on the shelves of her various rooms.",

  "I feel most of all that music is what the house needs, this osmosis into the high sentiments of one another so I can be any genius I want, including a composer.",
  "One secret of growing up and staying grown.",
  "My mind becomes Apollo’s mind while I cook and agitates when it hears for the first time details of score and, therefore, of feeling not clear before genius found and realized them and engineers uplifted mere performance to this high abstract version of the actual that gladdens the fumes I make and nourish by.",
  "Praised be the dozens of perfectionists who have rinsed and made absolute the notes the composer once exhaled for passion’s sake.",
  "But when I overhear Sarah in the front room trying her Bach, Mick in search of the right tenor note, a guest testing his want of skill on a hymn the whole family can play better but not well, there is exposed the amateur brown root of music, a commonplace stubborn as the smell of cabbage cooking, after which occasions I am always the downright cook tempering his vision of the human heart while he dresses up dead things it can’t live without.",
  "As I went into the tabac to buy two boxes of matches, I happened to glance to my right.",
  "Or else, as I glanced to the right on going into the tabac to buy two boxes of matches, or else I had gone into a tabac to buy two boxes of matches, and glancing to the right I saw a small woman, not old, not young, perched on a chair, and she was eating what I took to be a tartine, or else the remnant of a tartine.",
  "She held the bread in both hands, like a squirrel, and her feet did not touch the floor.",
  "She was a very small person, and her face was round and white.",
  "Then I asked for the matches, paid for them, and while turning to leave took a second look at the small woman.",
  "It was a small tabac, too, with only two or three tables and chairs lined up against the wall, and a mirror ran along the wall, reaching to the floor.",
  "The woman, perched on the chair, her feet not touching the floor, was half-turned toward the wall, she took a bite at her tartine, leaving behind a white streak of bread in her two clasped hands.",
  "She sat turned away from the rest of the tabac.",
  "But she was so small that her round white face hardly appeared in the mirror.",
  "She ate like a trapped animal.",
  "She did not want to be seen.",
  "She did not want to see herself, yet, turning her face away from the space of the tabac, she almost had to be seeing herself, in the mirror, and also in the mirror the inescapable tabac space in which she felt conspicuous.",
  "Or else: she was a very small woman with a round white face which nobody wanted to see, not even herself, but she had to be somewhere, in order to eat.",
  "Still, she was eating in such a way as to indicate that she wanted to live, hands clasping bread, even if living meant disappearing.",
  "All around her, all around me, in that small space, the packets of cigarettes and the boxes of matches, the people walking in the street, on their way from the day’s work, in their appropriate clothes, and the dogs going about their business, and the continuous roar of all the cars.",
  "Or else: I cannot say all around us.",
  "No common root, at best a rhizome, contrived by the other bodies and the noises, in their scatteredness, connected her particularity and mine, within a surface of observation more fleeting even than the last white shred of her tartine at which I saw her now sucking, not chewing, no, but sucking.",
  "The question of her teeth had not yet arisen.",
  "Strong teeth, squirrel teeth, grow in straight jaws, but hers might be weak teeth, in such round jaws.",
  "She lacked the courage, or else the presumption, to use a good toothpaste, and this had been going on for years.",
  "Nor had she the means to visit a dentist.",
  "Or else she had once scraped and saved, had once made an appointment, but the dentist had sent her away the moment he saw her.",
  "A tartine has a strong crust.",
  "So many sacrifices, in such a life.",
  "The cheapest food, a tartine, with ham or jam, and a little butter.",
  "Even then, she had to eat the tartine in her particular way, by sucking, and in public, she had to turn her face aside and not look, she wanted to eat while being invisible, she had a passion of great force, dangerous, for the tartines of this tabac, and here the rhizome put forth another bud, because in her I saw another being who had to aim, straight-on, for the impossible.",
  "Or else: I went into the tabac after spending an afternoon with a young woman, small and beautiful, with a laugh like the silver trickle of starlight seen in the water of a well.",
  "We had walked across bridges and along corridors, we had exchanged sweat from the palms of our hands, we had sat beside one another with mirrors behind us, gazing out into the world, or gazing at each other, in the envious ancient way of Assyrians; but who, now, among the ancient Assyrians would care to wonder about the small woman with the round white face, or who else, one century or two from now, in Paris, would want to know that she existed?",
  "She might never have been touched.",
  "I saw her short legs, white and lumpy, because, the way she sat, twisting away from the world, her skirt was hitched up to her knees.",
  "Nobody had ever wanted to stroke them.",
  "With her weak teeth she had never bitten anybody.",
  "With her small and frightened mouth she had never sucked anybody.",
  "Or else nobody living one century or two from now, no ancient Assyrian either, would, unless I am mistaken, want or have wanted to be bitten, or else sucked, by the small woman with the round white face and the unstroked legs.",
  "She was not a tiny soldier in the battle against chance, so by chance she had to be a nullity.",
  "When she looked in a mirror and saw herself, she might have found it hard to believe that this was all she was: not even worth a glance, but worse a pretext for averting every glance.",
  "Round, small, white zero, with a circumference nobody would dream of stroking into place, thus not even, really, a zero.",
  "The continuous roar of traffic.",
  "The dogs going about their business.",
  "Perched on the chair, a blob of absolute anxiety.",
  "Blob and there they go, the beautiful ancient Assyrians, and others, who can be seen, who think it is they who happen, not chance, who receive existence from a knowledge that they are to be seen; and there they go, the dogs, capering and sniffing, a blob in their track is a small woman with a round white face and wet-looking hair which nobody wants to comb or pat; a blob sucking a tartine in a tabac and looking aside, or else down, she wants only not to be there where everyone else happens to be going.",
  "Or else I am mistaken, entirely mistaken, and what I see is a large and very beautiful flea.",
  "A star among the fleas.",
  "And the dogs, in holy terror, worship her?",
  "From flea to angel, the spectrum of perception bends and cracks under the buffetings of chance, as, in a changed perspective, a world of different objects comes into position.",
  "Lens-grinding Spinoza says to the small woman she does not hear, and I may not have heard correctly: Every being which is made conscious of its interior power comes to persevere the more insistently in its particular nature.",
  "Never once did anything occur to the small woman such as might have shown her that plenitude of interior power.",
  "She perseveres because she has been doomed to do so, by the dogs in the street, or else like them, by the space of the tabac, by the mirror which has finally annulled even her capacity to despair of herself.",
  "Or else: A chair in a small tabac, her twisted body insisting on it, is this a likely perch for the Celestial Globe-Hopper, the Pure Flea Spirit?",
  "Passing from Spinoza’s triangle to the cube, I put one box of matches in my coat pocket, the other in my trouser pocket, and could not say whether or not I was mistaken.",
  "Or else I had ground this lens not cruelly enough, for I felt mounting in my throat a galaxy of tears; or else I was grinding into the lens not this indelible presence but my own shadow, nicotine, idiotic.",
  "From the field borders flows a dried-out baking quiet of thistledown and crumbs of soil.",
  "A grey velvet, which scratches on the throat and makes a fur on the tongue.",
  "The overheated, glassy air curdles under streaming strokes of shimmering.",
  "Earth-chilled springwater slurped in long, greedy gulps from the scoop.",

  "One of the last things he did in his life was to call his fifty-eight-year-old son-in-law honey.",
  "One afternoon in the early 1930’s, when I bloodied my head by pitching over a wall at the bottom of a hill and believed that the mere sight of my own blood was the tragic meaning of life, I heard my father offer to murder his future son-in-law.",
  "His son-in-law is my brother-in-law, whose name is Paul.",
  "These two grown men rose above me and knew that a human life is murder.",
  "They weren’t fighting about Paul’s love for my sister.",
  "They were fighting with each other because one strong man, a factory worker, was laid off from his work, and the other strong man, the driver of a coal truck, was laid off from his work.",
  "They were both determined to live their lives, and so they glared at each other and said they were going to live, come hell or high water.",

  "I used to be scared of the washing machine.",
  "My wife was always hinting it was dangerous to use, the same time berating me for not using it.",
  "When she left she left me the usual parting letter plus three pages of crabbed notes labelled Instructions for Operating Washing Machine.",
  "It took me a long time to pluck up the courage.",
  "Anyway, I did the blanket and lots of hairs came off.",
  "There were long brown ones, my own; long red henna’d ones, my wife’s; and some long blonde hairs that belonged to an Irish girl called Ann.",
  "They all got twisted together.",
  "I should have changed the water before doing the normal weekly load, but I didn’t.",

  "No one had ever seen it before.",
  "It was not bad-looking, and it spoke a language that was pleasant to hear, though none could understand it.",
  "The wonderful thing was that the child was perfectly unafraid, as if it were at home among its own people.",
  "The child got on well enough, but the next morning it was gone, as suddenly as it had appeared.",
  "Everyone was troubled.",
  "But then it came to be understood that the child never was, and everyone felt better.",
  "After all, said an old man, How can we believe in the child?",
  "It gave us not one word of sense to hold on to.",

  "There was a woman whose hair was long and heavy and black and beautiful.",
  "She drew it about her like a shawl and so divided herself from the world that not even Age could find her.",
  "Now and then she steals into the men’s societies and fits her voice into their holiest songs.",
  "And always, just there, is a shadow which the firelight cannot cleave.",
  "As if the house could not have been preserved in this spot at any time: not the basement, not the basement windows, not the windows looking out onto the garden.",
  "As if every war had intentionally focused on precisely this spot, on tearing out the stairs.",
  "As if every storm too, every stroke of lightning had struck the walls, every downpour brought the dark down on the helpless.",

  "This thing lying on the desk is now being seen by my eyes.",
  "I could pick it up at this moment.",
  "I could cut out a human figure with it.",
  "I might even cut off all my hair.",
  "Though it’s understood that murder is out of the question.",
  "Yet this thing also keeps getting rustier, blunter and older.",
  "It’s still useful but it’ll be thrown away before long.",
  "Although I have no way of knowing whether it’s made of ore from Chile or whether Krupp’s fingers have touched it, it’s not hard to imagine that it will finally return to its indeterminate destiny, moving away from its human formality back to its original state.",
  "This thing here on the desk is at this moment talking about such a time, not to anyone in particular but coldly, silently, as if it were not doing that.",
  "People manufactured this for practical purposes and yet it has inevitably come to exist here in this way before and apart from any practical purpose it might have.",
  "It’s something which could be variously named not just scissors.",
  "It already has countless other names.",
  "Habit alone keeps me from using the other names.",
  "Or is it out of self-defence?",
  "Because this thing, existing like this, has the power to extract words from me so that I go on being unreeled in this string of words and am always on the dangerous verge of being reduced to a far more thinner and feebler existence than that of the scissors.",
  "Lifting my coffee cup, I notice a caterpillar crawling over my sheet of ten-cent airmail stamps.",
  "The head is black as a Chinese box.",
  "Nine soft accordions follow it around, with a waving motion like a flabby mountain.",
  "Skinny brushes used to clean pop bottles rise from some of its shoulders.",
  "As I pick up the sheet of stamps, the caterpillar advances around and around the edge, and I see his feet: three pairs under the head, four spongelike pairs under the middle body, and two final pairs at the tip, pink as a puppy’s hind legs.",
  "As he walks, he rears, six pairs of legs off the stamp, waving around the air.",
  "One of the sponge pairs, and the last two tail pairs, the reserve feet, hold on anxiously.",
  "It is the first of September.",
  "The leaf shadows are less ferocious on the notebook cover.",
  "A man accepts his failures more easily or perhaps summer’s insanity is gone?",

  "The duty priest tested his diction against pillar and plaster, we tested our elbows on the hard bevel of the benches or split the gold-barred thickness of our missals.",
  "I could make a book of hours of those six years, a Flemish calendar of rite and pastime set on a walled hill.",
  "Look: there is a hillside cemetery behind us and across the river the plough going in a field and in between, the gated town.",
  "Here, an obedient clerk kissing a bishop’s ring, here a frieze of seasonal games, and here the assiduous illuminator himself, bowed to his desk in a corner.",
  "In the study hall my hand was cold as a scribe’s in winter.",
  "The supervisor rustled past, sibilant, vapouring into his breviary, his welted brogues unexpectedly secular under the soutane.",
  "Now I bisected the line AB, now found my foothold in a main verb in Livy.",
  "From my dormer after lights out I revised the constellations and in the morning broke the ice on an enamelled water-jug with exhilarated self-regard.",
  "You haven’t finished your ape, said mother to father, who had monkey hair and blood on his whiskers.",
  "I’ve had enough monkey, cried father.",
  "You didn’t eat the hands, and I went to all the trouble to make onion rings for its fingers, said mother.",
  "I’ll just nibble on its forehead, and then I’ve had enough, said father.",
  "I stuffed its nose with garlic, just like you like it, said mother.",
  "Why don’t you have the butcher cut these apes up?",
  "You lay the whole thing on the table every night; the same fractured skull, the same singed fur; like someone who died horribly.",
  "These aren’t dinners, these are post-mortem dissections.",
  "Try a piece of its gum, I’ve stuffed its mouth with bread, said mother.",
  "Ugh, it looks like a mouth full of vomit.",
  "How can I bite into its cheek with bread spilling out of its mouth?",
  "Break one of the ears off, they’re so crispy, said mother.",
  "I wish to hell you’d put underpants on these apes; even a jockstrap, screamed father.",
  "Father, how dare you insinuate that I see the ape as anything more than simple meat, screamed mother.",
  "Well what’s with this ribbon tied in a bow on its privates?",
  "Are you saying that I am in love with this vicious creature?",
  "That I would submit my female opening to this brute?",
  "That after we had love on the kitchen floor I would put him in the oven, after breaking his head with a frying pan; and then serve him to my husband, that my husband might eat the evidence of my infidelity-?",
  "I’m just saying that I’m damn sick of ape every night, cried father.",
  "Nothing to say for himself.",
  "After his death I learned what little there is: born Buncrana Inishowen Donegal, 1904; name of father Samuel; mother’s name Mary McGrory.",
  "She died in his birth.",
  "He was sent to England, to be raised by an uncle, a farmer, who didn’t want him.",
  "If he had any schooling it didn’t show.",
  "He wrote his name in a child’s scrawl, claimed poor eyesight to avoid reading, refused eyeglasses.",
  "My mother said when she met him he was carrying a suitcase with two shirts in it.",
  "He said he was born in Northumberland, to have come from there, that his father’s name was William.",
  "Maybe he knew, or had never been told.",
  "Or maybe the clerks merely tied up loose ends and matched two sets of papers to give me a life not his.",
  "He never would talk of it.",
  "She remembered he would stare at a knife and fork, not knowing which hand to take them in, when he came into the house he said goodnight in greeting.",
  "She married him, his silence and his violence and his gentleness.",
  "We went from farm to farm, a hired man living in a tied house, the furniture piled in a cattle truck.",
  "His fingers were frostbitten, white and stiff, I have spoken of them.",
  "Quarrelsome, proud and private, he could agree with no one.",
  "Locked out of one farm, he nailed every door and window to its jamb.",
  "Sacked from another, he fired the stackyard.",
  "He had no friends, confided in no one, his rhythm long quietness broken by bursts of sustained anger.",
  "It was his solitude I loved; his stern face coming in from the frost, a stolen chicken under his coat.",
  "And his shy grin, his slow walk through the fields, the dog circling him.",
  "He did nothing but work, so long as there was light to do it by, till the light went out of him, whatever it meant.",
  "I laboured to write this for him.",
  "The stone carries his name and dates and the middle name that may not be his, and a wild rose cut into its corner.",
  "There is another space, blank, waiting for the mallet.",
  "The chalk folds around him, waits for the sea’s coming.",
  "The silence has gone into itself.",
  "If the grave is that deep it is deeper.",
  "I walk away from it, valuing my life, the woman I married, the children she brought out of herself crying.",
  "Months later I discovered I was happy that my life meant it could not be given up.",
  "Whatever these are, whether they are poems or not, they are to celebrate, the drip of water building a tower of itself from the minerals it has gathered.",
  "The dead lie with bitterness in their mouths.",
  "Something of them comes back, as he does, it does not disturb me.",
  "They want to go on, or to return to settle what was not done here; it is what holds them back, this wanting.",
  "I am happy that he chooses sometimes to be with me.",
  "I am his son; my house is his and I welcome him, wondering, since he was a private man who preferred silence and kept from his own kind, how he gets on with the other dead.",
  "Knowing we have made peace, he and I, I want him to make peace with them.",
  "They tower below us, like wheat.",
  "At first there is a peep-hole on the living.",
  "It sneaks into the yard of lunatics, lifers, violent and violated nerves, cripples, tuberculars, victims of power sadism safely hidden from questions.",
  "A little square hole cut in the door, enough for a gaoler’s fist to pass through and manipulate the bolt from either side.",
  "Enough also for me to casually, oh so casually steal a quick look at the rare flash of a hand, a face, a gesture; more often a blur of khaki, the square planted rear of the guard on the other side.",
  "Until one day, a noise of hammering.",
  "All morning an assault of blows multiplied and magnified by the unique echoing powers of my crypt.",
  "When it thunders, my skull is the anvil of gods.",
  "By noon that breach is sealed.",
  "Only the sky is now open, a sky the size of a napkin trapped by tall spikes and broken bottles, but a sky.",
  "Vultures perch on a roof just visible from another yard.",
  "Egrets overfly my crypt and bats swarm at sunset.",
  "Albino bats, sickly pale, emitting radio pips to prowl the echo chamber.",
  "But the world is dead, suddenly.",
  "For an eternity after ceasing the hammers sustain their vehemence.",
  "Even the sky retracts, dead.",
  "Only something men read of.",
  "Buoys and landmarks vanish.",
  "Slowly, remorselessly, reality dissolves and certitude betrays the mind.",
  "Days weeks months, then as suddenly as that first death, a new sound, a procession.",
  "Feet approach, dragging to the clank of chains.",
  "And now another breach that has long remained indifferent, blank, a floodhole cut in the base of the wall, this emptiness slowly, gracelessly, begins to frame manacled feet.",
  "Nothing has ever passed so close, so ponderously across the floodhole of the Wailing Wall.",
  "I named it that, because it overlooks the yard where a voice cried out in agony all of one night and died at dawn, unattended.",
  "It is the yard from which hymns and prayers rise with a constancy matched only by the vigil of crows and vultures.",
  "And now, feet.",
  "Bare except for two pairs of boots which consciously walk deadweight to match the pace of manacles on the others.",
  "Towards noon the same procession passes the other way.",
  "Some days later the proession again goes by and I count.",
  "The third day of this procession wakes into the longest dawn that ever was born and died of silence, a silence replete and awesome.",
  "My counting stops brusquely at six.",
  "In that instant the ritual is laid bare, the silence, the furtive conspiracy of dawn, the muffled secrets hammer louder than manacles in my head, all all is bared in one paralysing understanding.",
  "Five men are walking the other way, five men walking even more slowly, wearily, with the weight of the world on each foot, on each step towards eternity.",
  "I hear them pause at every scrap of life, at every beat of the silence, at every mote in the sun, those five for whom the world is about to die.",
  "Sounds acquire a fourth dimension in a living crypt.",
  "A definition which, as in the case of thunder becomes physically unbearable.",
  "In the case of the awaited but unheard, psychically punishing.",
  "Pips from albino bats pock the babble of evensong moslem and christian, pagan and unclassifiable.",
  "My crypt they turn into a cauldron, an inverted bell of faiths whose sonorities are gathered, stirred, skimmed, sieved in the warp and weft of sooty mildew on walls, of green velvet fungus woven by the rain’s cunning fingers.",
  "From beyond the Wall of Mists the perverse piety of women, that inhuman patience to which they are born drifts across to lash the anguish from the Wall of Purgatory.",
  "A clap of wings a white-and-ochre bolt, a wood-pigeon diving and crossing, a restless shuttle threading sun-patches through this darkest of looms.",
  "Beyond and above the outside wall, a rustle of leaves a boy’s face.",
  "A guileless hunter unmasks, in innocence an evil labyrinth.",
  "I shall know his voice when children’s songs invade the cauldron of sounds at twilight, this pulse intrusion in the home of death.",
  "The sun is rising behind him.",
  "His head dissolves in the pool, a shuttle sinking in a fiery loom.",
  "King of the perennial holly-groves, the riven sandstone: overlord of the M5: architect of the historic rampart and ditch, the citadel at Tamworth, the summer hermitage in Holy Cross: guardian of the Welsh Bridge and the Iron Bridge: contractor to the desirable new estates: saltmaster: moneychanger: commissioner for oaths: martyrologist: the friend of Charlemagne.",
  "I liked that, said Offa, sing it again.",
  "A pet-name, a common name.",
  "Best-selling brand, curt graffito.",
  "A laugh; a cough.",
  "A specious gift.",
  "Scoffed-at horned phonograph.",
  "The starting-cry of a race.",
  "A name to conjure with.",
  "On the morning of the crowning we chorused our remission from school.",
  "It was like Easter: hankies and gift-mugs approved by his foreign gaze, the village-lintels curlered with paper flags.",
  "We gaped at the car-park of The Stag’s Head where a bonfire of beer-crates and holly-boughs whistled above the tar.",
  "And the chef stood there, a king in his new-risen hat, sealing his brisk largesse with any mustard?",
  "I was invested in mother-earth, the crypt of roots and endings.",
  "I abode there, bided my time: where the mole shouldered the clogged wheel, his gold solidus; where dry-dust badgers thronged the Roman flues, the long-unlooked-for mansions of our tribe.",
  "So much for the elves wergild, the true governance of England, the gaunt warrior-gospel armoured in engraved stone.",
  "I wormed my way heavenward for ages amid barbaric ivy, scrollwork of fern.",
  "Exile or pilgrim set me once more upon that ground: my rich and desolate childhood.",
  "Dreamy, smug-faced, sick on outings I who was taken to be a king of some kind, a prodigy, a maimed one.",
  "Brooding on the eightieth letter of Fors Clavigera, I speak this in memory of my grandmother, whose childhood and prime womanhood were spent in the nailer’s darg.",
  "The nailshop stood back of the cottage, by the fold.",
  "It reeked stale mineral sweat.",
  "Sparks had furred its low roof.",
  "In dawn-light the troughed water floated a damson-bloom of dust – not to be shaken by posthumous clamour.",
  "It is one thing to celebrate the quick forge’, another to cradle a face hare-lipped by the searing wire.",
  "Brooding on the eightieth letter of Fors Clavigera, I speak this in memory of my grandmother, whose childhood and prime womanhood were spent in the nailer’s darg.",
  "Now when King Offa was alive and dead’, they were all there, the funereal gleemen: papal legate and rural dean; Merovingian car-dealers, Welsh mercenaries; a shuffle of house-carls.",
  "He was defunct.",
  "They were perfunctory.",
  "The ceremony stood acclaimed.",
  "The mob received memorial vouchers and signs.",
  "After that shadowy, thrashing midsummer hail-storm, Earth lay for a while, the ghost-bride of livid Thor, butcher of strawberries, and the shire-tree dripped red in the arena of its uprooting.",
  "Processes of generation; deeds of settlement.",
  "The urge to marry well; wit to invest in the properties of healing-springs.",
  "Our children and our children’s children, o my masters.",
  "Tracks of ancient occupation.",
  "Frail ironworks rusting in the thorn-thicket.",
  "Hearthstones; charred lullabies.",
  "A solitary axe-blow that is the echo of a lost sound.",
  "Tumult recedes as though into the long rain.",
  "Groves of legendary holly; silverdark the ridged gleam.",
  "14 Whatever it was: the grains of the glacier caked in the boot-cleats; ashes spilled on white formica.",
  "The death-col viewed through power-glasses; the cube of ice melting on stainless steel.",
  "Whatever it was, the image that stopped you, the one on which you came to grief, projecting it over and over on empty walls.",
  "Now to give up the temptations of the projector; to see instead the web of cracks filtering across the plaster.",
  "To read there the map of the future, the roads radiating from the initial split, the filaments thrown out from that impasse.",
  "To reread the instructions on your palm; to find there how the lifeline, broken, keeps its direction.",
  "To read the etched rays of the bullet-hole left years ago in the glass; to know in every distortion of the light what fracture is.",
  "To put the prism in your pocket, the thin glass lens, the map of the inner city, the little book with gridded pages.",
  "To pull yourself up by your own roots; to eat the last meal in your old neighborhood.",
  "It was fetched from the dead woman’s apartment.",
  "It stood empty for a few days, empty, until I filled it with books, all the bound ones, the heavy ones.",
  "In doing so, I had let in the nether world.",
  "Something came from underneath, rose slowly and inexorably like a massive column of mercury.",
  "One was not allowed to turn one’s head away.",
  "The dark volumes, closed faces.",
  "They are like Algerians who stood at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint and waited for the Volkspolizei to examine their passports.",
  "My own passport has long since lain among the glass cages.",
  "And the haze which was in Berlin in those days is also inside the bookcase.",
  "In there lies an old despair that tastes of Passchendaele and the Versailles Peace, that tastes even older.",
  "The dark heavy tomes I come back to them they are in reality a kind of passport and they are so thick because they have collected so many stamps through the centuries.",
  "Evidently you cannot travel with enough heavy baggage, now when you set off, when you at last-All the old historians are there, they rise up there and look into our family.",
  "Nothing is heard but the lips are moving all the time behind the glass Passchendaele-.",
  "It makes you think of an aged civil service department a pure ghost-story follows, a building where portraits of long since dead men hang behind glass and one morning there was vapour on the inside of the glass.",
  "They had begun to breathe during the night.",
  "The bookcase is still more powerful.",
  "The glances straight across the border.",
  "A gleaming membrane, the gleaming membrane on a dark river which the room must see itself in.",
  "And one is not allowed to turn one’s head away.",
  "Milk used to come in tall glass, heavy and uncrystalline as frozen melted snow.",
  "It rose direct and thick as horse-chestnut tree trunks that do not spread out upon the ground even a little: a shaft of white drink narrowing at the cream and rounded off in a thick-lipped grin.",
  "Empty and unrinsed, a diluted milk ghost entrapped and dulled light and vision.",
  "Then things got a little worse: squared, high-shouldered and rounded off in the wrong places, a milk replica of a handmade Danish wooden milk bat.",
  "But that was only the beginning.",
  "Things got worse than that.",
  "Milk came in waxed paper that swelled and spilled and oozed flat pieces of milk.",
  "It had a little lid that didn’t close properly or resisted when pulled so that when it did give way milk jumped out.",
  "Things are getting better now.",
  "Milk is bigger half-a-gallon, at least in thin milky plastic with a handle, a jug founded on an oblong.",
  "Pick it up and the milk moves, rising enthusiastically in the neck as it shifts its center of weight.",
  "Heavy as a breast, but lighter, shaping itself without much changing shape: like bringing home the milk in a bandana, a neckerchief or a scarf, strong as canvas water wings whose strength was only felt dragged under water.",
  "On the highway this morning at the go-round, about where you leave New Hampshire, there had been an accident.",
  "Milk was sloshed on the gray-blue-black so much like a sheet of early winter ice you drove over it slowly, no matter what the temperature of the weather that eddied in through the shatterproof glass gills.",
  "There were milk-skins all around, the way dessert plates look after everyone has left the table in the Concord grape season.",
  "Only bigger, unpigmented though pretty opaque, not squashed but no less empty.",
  "Trembling, milk is coming into its own.",
  "On the first day they invented sand.",
  "And the sand settled into itself, just as they thought it would.",
  "After the sand had settled, they tried it out to see if it could be walked on.",
  "When they walked they sank in a little, but not enough to worry about.",
  "And they saw that they left marks in the sand.",
  "Every step they took left marks in the sand.",
  "They called them footprints.",
  "Now it was easier to see where they had walked.",
  "That was good.",
  "And they hadn’t invented wind and rain, so the footprints stayed where they were.",
  "That way others could follow them.",
  "If any others should want to.",
  "And that would be good.",
  "So on the very first day they made a lot of footprints in the sand.",
  "The whole first day they walked around and made footprints in the sand.",
  "When they really had made a lot of footprints in the sand, they sat down to rest and to enjoy the results of their efforts.",
  "They looked over the endless expanse and described it to each other.",
  "And when they were through describing it to each other and had no more to say to each other, either about the sand or about the many footprints they had made in the endless expanse, they saw that something was missing.",
  "And one of them said: I go in and out of this desert whenever I want On the second day they invented light.",
  "And the light spread by itself, as they had thought it would.",
  "When the light was through spreading and there was light everywhere, they saw that they could see the sand.",
  "And they immediately began to describe what they saw.",
  "Yellow and brown, they said.",
  "And green and blue and red, they said.",
  "And black and white, they said.",
  "And gray, they said.",
  "And they said it a lot of times.",
  "Finally they really felt that they were all seeing the same thing.",
  "And that was good.",
  "A little later they saw that they could also see each other.",
  "We can see each other, they said.",
  "Just like that.",
  "And because they had said it just like that, they felt that they were all seeing the same thing.",
  "And that was good.",
  "In the middle of the day, when the light was very strong, they realized the light was very strong, and they closed their eyes and sat down in the sand to rest and to keep from getting lost.",
  "They had never imagined that the light would be so strong.",
  "It’s taken over, they said.",
  "And while they sat there in the sand with their eyes closed, they really did suffer in the heat of all the light they had invented.",
  "They hadn’t invented wind and rain, remember.",
  "So there was no coolness at all.",
  "Let’s look away from it all for a moment, one of them said.",
  "So they did.",
  "And they really felt that they were all seeing the same thing.",
  "I can visualize the light, they said.",
  "That was how they suddenly understood that they had loved each other all along.",
  "On the third day they invented water.",
  "If they hadn’t, the water might have appeared by itself.",
  "It looks like it appeared by itself, they said.",
  "And they tried it out, to see if it could be walked on.",
  "They kept falling through.",
  "And when they went back to the sand their feet were wet, and the sand stuck to them.",
  "So they sat down and brushed the sand from their feet.",
  "At first it was hard because the sand was wet.",
  "Little by little it got easier because the sand dried.",
  "So they talked together about the sand and the water and their effects on each other.",
  "And they realized that they had felt the sand back on the first day.",
  "It had vanished between their fingers.",
  "So they felt the water.",
  "It vanished between their fingers.",
  "Finally they felt the light.",
  "It was as if our fingers were vanishing, they said.",
  "And they felt that now they had proof of their love.",
  "They call me that we have a case at the hospital.",
  "It is a fine night, not late, only a little after eleven.",
  "When I arrive, they tell me, Mr H— is going to operate.",
  "The patient is in the first bed on the left in the men’s ward.",
  "I go in.",
  "It is dark but some light comes from a wall fixture above the bed.",
  "He is a man in early life.",
  "I begin to ask the usual questions.",
  "I explain that I will give the anaesthetic for the operation.",
  "He says, My name is Pisgah.",
  "I nod and go on with my questions and examination.",
  "He appears tired and in some distress.",
  "The exact nature of his condition is still in doubt.",
  "It is true, when he tells me his name, I have a momentary surprise, which I suppress.",
  "The name is that of the mountain mentioned in the Bible from which Moses is said to have viewed the Promised Land.",
  "As a child, the name had intrigued me.",
  "It also occurs in a hymn, as if it were a man’s name: Pisgah’s Mount.",
  "I had often thought, singing the verse: who was Pisgah?",
  "I had used the name later, rather at random, for a person who existed in a story I was writing.",
  "It was a story upon which I had exerted myself and then, in one sense, abandoned.",
  "Pisgah, in fact, was the person in that story with whom I was most concerned.",
  "I had written two extended versions, and others more fragmentary, without being able to bring them to any satisfaction.",
  "That I had not finished those pieces did not mean that I had abandoned the work.",
  "To abandon a piece of writing is one thing.",
  "To abandon a work, is another.",
  "A particular piece of writing is a means, for a writer, which may not always finally serve the work.",
  "Thus, I write this, which also serves, for the moment.",
  "I give the anaesthetic while my friend Mr H— does the surgery.",
  "The details of the case are of no consequence.",
  "It goes well.",
  "Towards the end, when my attention is not too pressed with technical details, I have the chance to look more closely at Pisgah’s face.",
  "It is the face of a man asleep.",
  "As he sleeps, he is remote, both from himself and from us.",
  "Yet he sleeps by my will.",
  "I check his pulse, his blood pressure, his colour, his muscle tone, and gently assist each breath.",
  "In the story I had often had the experience that Pisgah was difficult to lay hold upon.",
  "His character seemed to change.",
  "Even the details of what he did or said.",
  "I had wanted to discover who exactly he was.",
  "So that I could, in some way, come to terms with him, to finish the story.",
  "Now, suddenly, I felt him alive against my hand.",
  "And that life dependent upon my attention.",
  "If my attention should fail, I might lose him for ever.",
  "I speak occasionally with Mr H—.",
  "Sometimes about the details of what he is doing.",
  "Sometimes about other things entirely.",
  "Neither of us speaks of the man with whom, in our several ways, we are involved.",
  "Later, before leaving the hospital, I make a last routine visit to Pisgah’s bed.",
  "He is now partly awake and responds to a touch on the face or a simple question.",
  "I look again into that face, somewhat firmer now, and occasionally tightened by the first twinges of pain from the incision.",
  "Who are you?",
  "He smiles faintly, out of his half sleep, as if amused that after all this time I should not know.",
  "I was sitting upstairs in a bus, cursing the waste of time, and pouring my life away on one of those insane journeys across London while gradually the wavering motion of this precarious glass salon, that flung us about softly like trusses of wheat or Judo Lords, began its medicinal work inside the magnetic landscape of London.",
  "The bus, with its transparent decks of people, trembled.",
  "And was as uniquely ceremonious in propelling itself as an eminent Jellyfish with an iron will, by expulsions, valves, hisses, steams, and emotional respirations.",
  "A militant, elementary, caparisoned Jellyfish, of the feminine sex, systematically eating and drinking the sea.",
  "I began to feel as battered as though I had been making love all night.",
  "My limbs distilled the same interesting wide-awake weariness.",
  "We went forward at a swimmer’s pace, gazing through the walls that rocked the weather about like a cloudy drink from a chemist’s shop with the depth and sting of the Baltic.",
  "The air-shocks, the sulphur dioxides, the gelatin ignitions.",
  "We were all of us parcelled up in mud-coloured clothes, dreaming, while the rich perishable ensemble as stuffy and exclusive as a bag of fish and chips, or as an Eskimo’s bed in a glass drift cautiously advanced as though on an exercise from a naval college.",
  "The jogging was consistently idiotic, it induced a feeling of complete security.",
  "I gave up my complicated life on the spot; and lay screwed up like an old handkerchief screwed up in a pocket, suspended in time, ready to go to the ends of the earth.",
  "O trans-Siberian railways.",
  "This is not my home.",
  "How did I get so far from water?",
  "It must be over that way somewhere.",
  "I am the color of wine, of tinta.",
  "The inside of my powerful right claw is saffron-yellow.",
  "See, I see it now; I wave it like a flag.",
  "I am dapper and elegant; I move with great precision, cleverly managing all my smaller yellow claws.",
  "I believe in the oblique, the indirect approach, and I keep my feelings to myself.",
  "But on this strange, smooth surface I am making too much noise.",
  "I wasn’t meant for this.",
  "If I maneuver a bit and keep a sharp lookout, I shall find my pool again.",
  "Watch out for my right claw, all passersby.",
  "This place is too hard.",
  "The rain has stopped, and it is damp, but still not wet enough to please me.",
  "My eyes are good, though small; my shell is tough and tight.",
  "In my own pool are many small gray fish.",
  "I see right through them.",
  "Only their large eyes are opaque, and twitch at me.",
  "They are hard to catch but I, I catch them quickly in my arms and eat them up.",
  "What is that big soft monster, like a yellow cloud, stifling and warm?",
  "What is it doing?",
  "It pats my back.",
  "There, I have frightened it away.",
  "It’s sitting down, pretending nothing’s happened.",
  "I’ll skirt it.",
  "It’s still pretending not to see me.",
  "Out of my way, O monster.",
  "I own a pool, all the little fish that swim in it, and all the skittering waterbugs that smell like rotten apples.",
  "Cheer up, O grievous snail.",
  "I tap your shell, encouragingly, not that you will ever know about it.",
  "And I want nothing to do with you, either, sulking toad.",
  "Imagine, at least four times my size and yet so vulnerable-I could open your belly with my claw.",
  "You glare and bulge, a watchdog near my pool; you make a loud and hollow noise.",
  "I do not care for such stupidity.",
  "I admire compression, lightness, and agility, all rare in this loose world.",
  "My flag is blue and sports a fish rampant, locked in and let loose by two bracelets.",
  "In winter, when the wind blows hard and there’s no one about in these out-of-the-way places, I like to hear the flag crack like a whip with the fish swimming in the sky as if it were alive.",
  "And why this fish, I’m asked.",
  "Is it mystical?",
  "Yes, I say, it is the ichthyous symbol, the prechristic, the luminocratic, the friddled, the true, the fried, the fried fish.",
  "And nothing else?",
  "But in high winter, the flag thrashes up there with its fish in the air, trembling with cold, wind and sky.",
  "Isn’t it terribly cold there?",
  "She asked, and then sighed with relief.",
  "So many countries have been turning up lately that the safest thing to talk about is climate.",
  "Madame, I want to reply, my people’s poets do all their writing in mittens.",
  "I don’t mean to imply that they never remove them; they do, indeed, if the moon is warm enough.",
  "In stanzas composed of raucous whooping, for only such can drown the windstorms constant roar, they glorify the simple lives of our walrus herders.",
  "Our Classicists engrave their odes with inky icicles on trampled snowdrifts.",
  "The rest, our Decadents, bewail their fate with snowflakes instead of tears.",
  "He who wishes to drown himself must have an ax at hand to cut the ice.",
  "Oh, madame, dearest madame.",
  "That’s what I mean to say.",
  "But I’ve forgotten the word for walrus in French.",
  "And I’m not sure of icicle and ax.",
  "Isn’t it terribly cold there?",
  "Pas du tout, I answer icily.",
  "Ways over and ways to wait.",
  "Place for a stance or a stillness.",
  "Places, too, for violence.",
  "Bridges are blown and a war starts.",
  "And in the water you can see the fish if you watch carefully, if you side-step your own shadow, if you gaze deeper than self-love or arrogance.",
  "Many have paused here.",
  "Have noted the faint sky reflected, the full moon falling, it seems, in the water.",
  "Have fallen in love with the dark.",
  "For her, they were ways merely.",
  "Bridges meant building, meant the creak of planks, the delicate balance where wood is articulate, where men move as one, where the water is conquered.",
  "Where prayer is most painful, she sought for an image.",
  "Others learnt light, air, steps, birds the dove as a pretext or omen.",
  "All insubstantial for her.",
  "She needed the passion, the building, something to cleave and connect.",
  "Not standing there, letting the night drown in the water, watching the dear shadows that hold off the mountain.",
  "For her, the poise before the moment’s abandon, all the reprisals of pain.",
  "Pope, people, kings, confessors came to her.",
  "Proud professions passed over her bridges.",
  "Only Siena round hill-city, seething with feud and friendship was the safe place, solid ground, sweet summit where winds meet.",
  "Only here were bridges redundant.",
  "Can light heal?",
  "Can the fountain surrender?",
  "Dare the fisherman pause?",
  "Her bridges were built for a journey.",
  "The unconcerned waters flowed on.",
  "Walking through the suburb at night, as I pass the dentist’s house I hear a clock chime a quarter, a desolate brassy sound.",
  "I know where it stands, on the mantelpiece in the still surgery.",
  "The chime falls back into the house, and beyond it, without end.",
  "I sense the simple nakedness of these tiers of sleeping men and women beneath whose windows I pass.",
  "I imagine it in its own setting, a mean bathroom in a house no longer new, a bathroom with plank panelling, painted a peculiar shade of green by an amateur, and badly preserved.",
  "It is full of steam, so much as to obscure the yellow light and hide the high, patched ceiling.",
  "In this dream, standing quiet, the private image of the householder or his wife, damp and clean.",
  "I see this as it might be floating in the dark, as if the twinkling point of a distant street-lamp had blown in closer, swelling and softening to a foggy oval.",
  "I can call up a series of such glimpses that need have no end, for they are all the bodies of strangers.",
  "Some are deformed or diseased, some are ashamed, but the peace of humility and weakness is there in them all.",
  "I have often felt myself to be vicious, in living so much by the eye, yet among so many people.",
  "I can be afraid that the egg of light through which I see these bodies might present itself as a keyhole.",
  "Yet I can find no sadism in the way I see them now.",
  "They are warmfleshed, yet their shapes have the minuscule, remote morality of some mediaeval woodcut of the Expulsion: an eternally startled Adam, a permanently bemused Eve.",
  "I see them as homunculi, moving privately each in a softly lit fruit in a nocturnal tree.",
  "I can consider without scorn or envy the well-found bedrooms I pass, walnut and rose-pink, altars of tidy, dark-haired women, bare-backed, wifely.",
  "Even in these I can see order.",
  "I come quite often now upon a sort of ecstasy, a rag of light blowing among the things I know, making me feel I am not the one for whom it was intended, that I have inadvertently been looking through another’s eyes and have seen what I cannot receive.",
  "I want to believe I live in a single world.",
  "That is why I am keeping my eyes at home while I can.",
  "The light keeps on separating the world like a table knife: it sweeps across what I see and suggests what I do not.",
  "The imaginary comes to me with as much force as the real, the remembered with as much force as the immediate.",
  "The countries on the map divide and pile up like ice-floes: what is strange is that I feel no stress, no grating discomfort among the confusion, no loss; only a belief that I should not be here.",
  "I see the iron fences and the shallow ditches of the countryside the mild wind has travelled over.",
  "I cannot enter that countryside; nor can I escape it.",
  "I cannot join together the mild wind and the shallow ditches, I cannot lay the light across the world and then watch it slide away.",
  "Each thought is at once translucent and icily capricious.",
  "A polytheism without gods.",
  "The other one, the one called Borges, is the one things happen to.",
  "I walk through the streets of Buenos Aires and stop for a moment, perhaps mechanically now, to look at the arch of an entrance hall and the grillwork on the gate; I know of Borges from the mail and see his name on a list of professors or in a biographical dictionary.",
  "I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typography, the taste of coffee and the prose of Stevenson; he shares these preferences, but in a vain way that turns them into the attributes of an actor.",
  "It would be an exaggeration to say that ours is a hostile relationship; I live, let myself go on living, so that Borges may contrive his literature, and this literature justifies me.",
  "It is no effort for me to confess that he has achieved some valid pages, but those pages cannot save me, perhaps because what is good belongs to no one, not even to him, but rather to the language and to tradition.",
  "Besides, I am destined to perish, definitively, and only some instant of myself can survive in him.",
  "Little by little, I am giving over everything to him, though I am quite aware of his perverse custom of falsifying and magnifying things.",
  "Spinoza knew that all things long to persist in their being; the stone eternally wants to be a stone and the tiger a tiger.",
  "I shall remain in Borges, not in myself if it is true that I am someone, but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others or in the laborious strumming of a guitar.",
  "Years ago I tried to free myself from him and went from the mythologies of the outskirts to the games with time and infinity, but those games belong to Borges now and I shall have to imagine other things.",
  "Thus my life is a flight and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion, or to him.",
  "I do not know which of us has written this page.",
  "It is absolutely clear and absolutely sunny as if neither a cloud nor a moon had ever been invented.",
  "I am lying here on the grass of the University of California, a slave state but one which today seems peculiarly beneficent.",
  "I have not had a letter from you in weeks.",
  "I read them all your letters and mine to the poets assembled for the occasion last Wednesday.",
  "Ebbe was annoyed since he thought that letters should remain letters unless they were essays and poems poems a black butterfly just flew past my leg and that the universe of the personal and the impersonal should be kept in order.",
  "George Stanley thought that I was robbing Jim to pay James.",
  "They sounded beautiful all of them.",
  "Things cannot die in such a spring unless the old men of the world commit suicide our suicide over the question of whether East Germans be called East Germans in diplomatic notes and every leaf and flower of this red-hot February asks me to remember this.",
  "Though it is on the other side of poetry, spring, thank whatever created both of them, is spring.",
  "And I am not sure on a day like this that the living and dying world does not have something analogous to poetry in it.",
  "That every flower and every leaf properly read is not a James as well as a Jim.",
  "Things cannot die in such a spring and yet your silence for the spring itself proclaims that there are such things as clouds and moons frightens me when I close my eyes or begin to write a poem.",
  "I wish you were with me now on this grass and could be with me like the leaves and the flowers and the grass a part of this spring.",
  "Jim and James.",
  "Hermes is going along in the world.",
  "He meets a dog.",
  "I’m a god Hermes introduces himself politely.",
  "The dog sniffs his feet.",
  "I feel lonely.",
  "People betray the gods.",
  "But mortal animals without self-consciousness, that’s what we want.",
  "In the evening after traveling all day we’ll sit down under an oak.",
  "Then I’ll tell you I feel old and want to die.",
  "It’ll be a lie necessary to get you to lick my hands.",
  "Sure the dog replies casually I’ll lick your hands.",
  "They’re cold and they smell strange.",
  "They go along and after a while they meet a star.",
  "I’m Hermes the god says and produces one of his most handsome faces.",
  "Would you by any chance feel like coming with us to the end of the world?",
  "I’ll try to work it so that it’s scary there and you have to lean your head on my arm.",
  "OK says the star in a glassy voice.",
  "I don’t care where I go.",
  "But your saying the end of the world is pure naïveté.",
  "Sadly, there is no end of the world.",
  "They go along.",
  "The dog, Hermes, and the star.",
  "Hermes thinks to himself: the next time he goes out looking for friends, he won’t be so sincere.",
  "Where the tennis court once was, enclosed by the small rectangle down by the railroad tracks where the wild pines grow, the couch-weed now runs matted over the ground, and the rabbits scratch in the tall grass in those hours when it is safe to come out.",
  "One day here two sisters came to play, two white butterflies, in the early hours of the afternoon.",
  "Toward the east the view was and still is open and the damp rocks of the Corone still ripen the strong grapes for the sciacchetra’.",
  "It is curious to think that each of us has a country like this one, even if altogether different, which must always remain his landscape, unchanging; it is curious that the physical order of things is so slow to filter down into us, and then so impossible to drain back out.",
  "But what of the rest?",
  "Actually, to ask the how and why of the interrupted game is like asking the how and why of that scarf of vapor rising from the loaded cargo ship anchored down there at the docks of Palmaria.",
  "Soon they will light, in the gulf, the first lamps.",
  "Around, as far as the eye can see, the iniquity of objects persists, intangibly.",
  "The grotto encrusted with shells should be unchanged in the dense and heavy-planted garden under the tennis court; but the fanatical uncle will come no more with his tripod camera and magnesium lamp to photograph the single flower, unrepeatable, risen from the spiny cactus, and predestined to live only the shortest of lives.",
  "Even the villas of the South Americans seem deserted.",
  "And there haven’t always been the heirs and heiresses ready to squander their sumptuously shoddy goods that came always side-by-side with the rattle of pesos and milreis.",
  "Or maybe the sarabande of the newly arrived tells us of passings on to other regions: surely we here are perfectly sheltered and out of the line of fire.",
  "It is almost as though life could not be ignited here except by lightning; as though it feeds only on such inert things as it can safely accumulate; as though it quickly cankers in such deserted zones.",
  "Del salon en angulo oscuro silenciosa y cubierta de polvo veiase el arpa-Oh, yes, the museum would be impressive if one were able to uncover this ex-paradise of Victoriana.",
  "And no one was ever seen again on the seashell-inlayed terrace, supported by the giant Neptune now scraped clean after the Lion of Callao lost the election, and died; but there, by the outrageous bay window, frescoed in pears, apples and the serpents of the earthly paradise, the good-hearted Señora Paquita thought, in vain, to carry out her serene old age, comforted by her wily needles and the smile of posterity.",
  "But one day the husbands of the daughters arrived Brazilian sons-in-law, and, the mask having been ripped away, carried these good things off.",
  "Of the duenna, and the others, not a word more was ever heard one of the descendants came back later and performed miracles, it is said.",
  "By then, however, it was, more or less, the time of the Tripolitan hymns.",
  "And these objects, these houses, stayed inside the living circle so long as it lasted.",
  "For few felt from the start that the cold was actually coming; and among these, perhaps, was my father who, even during the hottest days of August, supper out on the terrace over carried on amidst moths and more persistent insects, and after having thrown a wool shawl around his shoulders, would repeat, always in French for who knows what reason, il fait bien froid, bien froid’; then he would go off immediately into his room and lie down on the bed and smoke his 7 centime Cavour.",
  "What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.",
  "In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations.",
  "What peaches and what penumbras.",
  "Whole families shopping at night.",
  "Aisles full of husbands.",
  "Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes.",
  "And you, García Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?",
  "I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.",
  "I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops?",
  "What price bananas?",
  "Are you my Angel?",
  "I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.",
  "We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.",
  "Where are we going, Walt Whitman?",
  "The doors close in an hour.",
  "Which way does your beard point tonight?",
  "I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.",
  "Will we walk all night through solitary streets?",
  "The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we’ll both be lonely.",
  "Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?",
  "Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?",
  "In the warm air of the ceiling the footlights of dreams turn on.",
  "The white walls have curved.",
  "The burdened chest breathes confused words.",
  "In the mirror, the wind from the south spins, carrying leaves and feathers.",
  "The window is blocked.",
  "The heart is almost extinguished among the already cold ashes of the moon the hands are without shelter as all the trees lying down.",
  "In the wind from the desert the needles bend and my hour is past.",
  "Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde?",
  "Or religious as if I were French?",
  "Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list. , but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.",
  "Why should I share you?",
  "Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?",
  "I am the least difficult of men.",
  "All I want is boundless love.",
  "Even trees understand me.",
  "Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I?",
  "I’m just like a pile of leaves.",
  "However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures.",
  "One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life.",
  "It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass.",
  "Do they know what they’re missing?",
  "My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me.",
  "I am always looking away.",
  "Or again at something after it has given me up.",
  "It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still.",
  "If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something.",
  "It’s not that I am curious.",
  "On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth.",
  "And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.",
  "Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven.",
  "You are inexorably approaching.",
  "How discourage her?",
  "St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky.",
  "How am I to become a legend, my dear?",
  "I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus the ecstasy of always bursting forth.",
  "But one must not be distracted by it.",
  "Or like a hyacinth, to keep the filth of life away, yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines.",

  "I wish She had a good Whipping and 10, 000 pounds.",
  "I’ve got to get out of here.",
  "I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans.",
  "I’ll be back, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to.",
  "It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead.",
  "There won’t be any mail downstairs.",
  "Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.",
  "Yesterday afternoon in the museum I saw a small ivory column painted blue, pink and yellow.",
  "For that one simple column, which is utterly useless and meaningless to our modern lives, for that simple little column of ivory painted by your tender hands like autumn leaves I would have given the ten most beautiful years of my life, ten years of love and faith, each year equally useless and meaningless.",
  "Next to the small column I also saw, young Tutankhamun, yesterday afternoon I also saw it was one of those clear afternoons of your beloved Egypt I also saw your heart enclosed in a golden chest.",
  "For that small heart of dust, for that small heart kept in a gold, enamel box, I would have given my young, warm, and still pure heart.",
  "Because yesterday afternoon, my King full of Death, my heart beat full of life for you, and my life embraced your death and seemed to melt into it.",
  "The hard death that sticks to your bones melted under the heat of my breath and the blood of my dream, and from so much mixing of love and death I’m still intoxicated from so much dying and loving.",
  "Yesterday afternoon, an Egyptian afternoon speckled with white ibises, I loved your impossible eyes through the glass.",
  "And in some other distant Egyptian afternoon not unlike this one the light broken up by birds your eyes were immense, two long slits stretching to your trembling temples.",
  "A long time ago on an afternoon like this one your eyes lay down on the earth, and they opened on it like your country’s two mysterious lotuses.",
  "They were crimson eyes refreshed by twilights and high rivers in the month of September.",
  "Your eyes were the owners of a kingdom that boasted cities in full bloom, giant stones that had already been there for millions of years, lands sown to the horizon, armies that conquered territories extending beyond the sandy wastelands of the Nubian desert, and those renowned archers and intrepid charioteers who have remained in profile forever, as still as hieroglyphics and monoliths.",
  "Everything fit in your eyes, tender, most powerful King.",
  "Everything was destined for you before you had time to gaze on it.",
  "And you certainly had no time.",
  "Now your eyes are shut and there is a gray dust on your eyelids.",
  "They have nothing now but this gray dust, this ash of long-consumed dreams, and now, between your eyes and mine, there is an impenetrable glass.",
  "For those eyes of yours, which I couldn’t half-open with my kisses, I would give my own two eyes to whoever wants them, my own two eyes, so avid for landscapes, and like two thieves that steal from your sky, like masters of the world’s sun.",
  "I would give away my living eyes just to feel your gaze come to me through three thousand nine hundred years, to feel it upon me, to feel it come, vaguely terrifying, bearing the pale halo of Isis.",
  "Young King Tutankhamun, dead at nineteen years of age, let me tell you these absurd words that perhaps no one ever told you, let me tell them to you in the solitude of my hotel room, in the frigidity of walls shared with strangers, walls colder than those of the tomb you didn’t want to share with anyone.",
  "I tell them to you, adolescent King, you who were left in the stillness of your youthful profile, left in your crystalline grace, left in the gesture that prohibited the sacrifice of innocent doves in the temple of the terrible Ammon-Ra.",
  "This is how I will go on seeing you when I am faraway, standing tall before suspicious priests and circled by a flurry of white wings taking flight.",
  "I will have nothing of you, nothing but this dream, because everything that is you is now reserved, prohibited, and infinitely impossible.",
  "For hundreds of years your gods held a vigil for you, hanging to the last hair on your head.",
  "I think your hair must have been straight like the rain that falls in the night.",
  "For your hair and your doves and your nineteen years so close to death, I would have been what I will never be: a fragment of love.",
  "But you didn’t wait for me.",
  "You walked along the edge of a crescent moon.",
  "You left me and went to the kingdom of the dead the way a child goes to a park, followed by your shimmering gazelles and your ivory carriage full of toys that still entertained you.",
  "If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become indignant, I would have kissed your toys one by one, your heavy gold and silver toys, your strange exotic toys that children of today, who box and play soccer, would never know how to use.",
  "If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become scandalized, I would have taken you out of your sarcophagus, which itself was inside three wooden sarcophagi, which were themselves inside a great granite sarcophagus.",
  "I would have lifted you out of the sinister depths, the sinister depths in which you grow more dead, more dead before my emboldened heart, which beats for you alone.",
  "For you alone, Sweetest of All Kings, my heart beats on this clear Egyptian afternoon on the Nile’s luminous arm.",
  "If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become furious, I would have taken you out of your five different sarcophagi, I would have loosed you from the bindings that press too heavily on your indelible body and I would have gently wrapped you in my silk shawl.",
  "I would have held you to my chest like a sick little boy and I would have sung to you the most beautiful, the most tender, of my tropical songs.",
  "I would have sung to you, sweet King, the shortest of all my poems.",
  "And to fill all these white pages that are left for me with the same monotonous question: at what hour do the hours end?",
  "And the anterooms, the memorials, the intrigues, the negotiations with the Janitor, the Rotating Chairman, the Secretary, the Associate, the Delegate.",
  "To glimpse the Influential from afar and to send my card each year to remind who?",
  "That in some corner, devoted, steady, plodding, although not very sure of my existence, I too await the coming of my hour, I too exist.",
  "Yes, I know, I could settle down in an idea, in a custom, in an obsession.",
  "Or stretch out on the coals of a pain or some hope and wait there, not making much noise.",
  "Of course it’s not so bad: I eat, drink, sleep, make love, observe the marked holidays and go to the beach in summer.",
  "People like me and I like them.",
  "I take my condition lightly: sickness, insomnia, nightmares, social gatherings, the idea of death, the little worm that burrows into the heart or the liver the little worm that leaves its eggs in the brain and at night pierces the deepest sleep, the future at the expense of today the today that never comes on time, that always loses its bets.",
  "I renounce my ration card, my I. D., my birth certificate, voter’s registration, passport, code number, countersign, credentials, safe conduct pass, insignia, tattoo, brand.",
  "The world stretches out before me, the vast world of the big, the little, and the medium.",
  "Universe of kings and presidents and jailors, of mandarins and pariahs and liberators and liberated, of judges and witnesses and the condemned: stars of the first, second, third and nth magnitudes, planets, comets, bodies errant and eccentric or routine and domesticated by the laws of gravity, the subtle laws of falling, all keeping step, all turning slowly or rapidly around a void.",
  "Where they claim the central sun lies, the solar being, the hot beam made out of every human gaze, there is nothing but a hole and less than a hole: the eye of a dead fish, the giddy cavity of the eye that falls into itself and looks at itself without seeing.",
  "There is nothing with which to fill the hollow center of the whirlwind.",
  "The springs are smashed, the foundations collapsed, the visible or invisible bonds that joined one star to another, one body to another, one man to another, are nothing but a tangle of wires and thorns, a jungle of claws and teeth that twist us and chew us and spit us out and chew us again.",
  "No one hangs himself by the rope of a physical law.",
  "The equations fall tirelessly into themselves.",
  "And in regard to the present matter, if the present matters: I do not belong to the masters.",

  "Am I innocent?",
  "Am I guilty?",
  "I’m innocent when I’m guilty, guilty when I’m innocent.",
  "I’m guilty when-but that is another song.",
  "It’s all the same song.",
  "Guilty innocent, innocent guilty, the fact is I quit.",
  "I remember my loves, my conversation, my friendships.",

  "With melancholy, but without nostalgia.",
  "And above all, without hope.",
  "I know that it is immortal, and that, if we are anything, we are the hope of something.",
  "For me, expectation has spent itself.",
  "I quit the nevertheless, the even, the in spite of everything, the moratoriums, the excuses and forgiving.",
  "I know the mechanism of the trap of morality and the drowsiness of certain words.",
  "I have lost faith in all those constructions of stone, ideas, ciphers.",
  "I no longer defend this broken tower.",
  "And, in silence, I await the event.",
  "A light breeze, slightly chilly, will start to blow.",
  "The newspapers will talk of a cold wave.",
  "The people will shrug their shoulders and continue life as always.",
  "The first deaths will barely swell the daily count, and no one in the statistics bureau will notice that extra zero.",
  "But after a while everyone will begin to look at each other and ask: what’s happening?",
  "Because for months doors and windows are going to rattle, furniture and trees will creak.",
  "For years there will be a shivering in the bones and a chattering of teeth, chills and goose bumps.",
  "For years the chimneys, prophets, and chiefs will howl.",
  "The mist that hangs over stagnant ponds will drift into the city.",
  "And at noon beneath the equivocal sun, the breeze will drag the smell of dry blood from a slaughterhouse abandoned even by flies.",
  "No use going out or staying at home.",
  "No use erecting walls against the impalpable.",
  "A mouth will extinguish all the fires, a doubt will root up all the decisions.",
  "It will be everywhere without being anywhere.",
  "It will blur all the mirrors.",
  "Penetrating walls and convictions, vestments and well-tempered souls, it will install itself in the marrow of everyone.",
  "Whistling between body and body, crouching between soul and soul.",
  "And all the wounds will open because, with expert and delicate, although somewhat cold, hands, it will irritate sores and pimples, will burst pustules and swellings and dig into the old, badly healed wounds.",
  "Oh fountain of blood, forever inexhaustible.",
  "Life will be a knife, a gray and agile and cutting and exact and arbitrary blade that falls and slashes and divides.",
  "To crack, to claw, to quarter, the verbs that move with giant steps against us.",
  "It is not the sword that shines in the confusion of what will be.",
  "It is not the saber, but fear and the whip.",
  "I speak of what is already among us.",
  "Everywhere there are trembling and whispers, insinuations and murmurs.",
  "Everywhere the light wind blows, the breeze that provokes the immense whiplash each time it unwinds in the air.",
  "Already many carry the purple insignia in their flesh.",
  "The light wind rises from the meadows of the past, and hurries closer to our time.",
  "A sea of feathers billows.",
  "It billows with happy billows.",
  "It billows with hilarious, happy billows of white, red and yellow feathers.",
  "It chirps, crows, pipes, flirts and trills around the star’s throne.",
  "But how are we to imagine the throne of the star?",
  "Deep, formless, blue, unending, green, terrifying.",
  "I saw the old god of war standing on a stump, on one side an abyss, on the other a cliff wall.",
  "He smelled of free beer and carbolic and he showed off his gonads to the teenagers, the while some professors had rejuvenated him.",
  "In his hoarse wolf’s voice he declared his love for all that is young.",
  "And there was a pregnant woman standing by, and she shivered.",
  "And he continued without shame, presenting himself as a great champion of order.",
  "And he described how he created order in the barns, by emptying them.",
  "As a man may scatter crumbs for the sparrows, so he fed poor people with crusts of bread he had taken from poor people.",
  "His voice was sometimes loud, sometimes quiet, but always hoarse.",
  "In a loud voice he spoke of the great times to come, and in a quiet voice he taught the women how to boil crows and seagulls.",
  "All the while he was uneasy in himself, and he looked over his shoulder time and again as if in fear of a stab in the back.",
  "And every five minutes he assured his public that he was minded to make his entrance brief.",
  "Swift with wings too wide, wheeling and shrieking his joy around the house.",
  "Such is the heart.",
  "He dries up thunder.",
  "He sows in the serene sky.",
  "If he touches ground, he tears himself apart.",
  "His response is the swallow, the familiar, whom he detests.",
  "What value has lace from the tower?",
  "His pause is in the most somber hollow.",
  "No one lives in space more narrow than he.",
  "Through the summer of long brightness, he will streak his way in shadows, by the blinds of midnight.",
  "No eyes can hold him.",
  "He shrieks for his only presence.",
  "A slight gun is about to fell him.",
  "Such is the heart.",
  "And why not the hedge of geysers the obelisks of hours the smooth cry of clouds the quartered sea pale green bedunged by good-for-nothing birds and hope playing marbles on the beams and for-the-time-beings of houses and the sea bream rips of banana tree suckers in the top branches of the sun on the stubbed heart of mornings on the acrid canvas of the sky a day of chalk of falcon of rain and acacia on a portulan of primeval islands shaking their salt hair interposed by fingers of masts in every hand to every purpose beneath the batting of an eyelash of chance with its shadow sung delights an assassin clad in rich and calm muslins like a chant of hard wine",
  "The rain, in the courtyard where I watch it fall, comes down at very different speeds.",
  "In the centre, it is a fine discontinuous curtain or mesh, falling implacably but relatively slowly, a drizzle, a never-ending languid precipitation, an intense dose of pure meteor.",
  "Not far from the right and left walls heavier drops fall more noisily, separately.",
  "Here they seem to be about the size of a grain of wheat, there of a pea, elsewhere nearly a marble.",
  "On the moulding, on the window ledges, the rain runs horizontally while on the undersides of these same obstacles it is suspended, plump as a humbug.",
  "It streams across the entire surface of a little zinc roof the peephole looks down on, in a thin moiré sheet due to the different currents set in motion by the imperceptible undulations and bumps in the roofing.",
  "From the adjoining gutter, where it runs with the restraint of a brook in a nearly level bed, it suddenly plunges in a perfectly vertical, coarsely braided stream to the ground, where it splatters and springs up again flashing like needles.",
  "Each of its forms has a particular speed: each responds with a particular sound.",
  "The whole lives as intensely as a complicated mechanism, as precise as it is chancy, a clockwork whose spring is the weight of a given mass of precipitate vapour.",
  "The chiming of the vertical streams on the ground, the gurgling of the gutters, the tiny gong beats multiply and resound all at once in a concert without monotony, not without delicacy.",
  "When the spring is unwound, certain gears continue to function for a while, gradually slowing down, until the whole mechanism grinds to a halt.",
  "Then, if the sun comes out, everything is erased, the brilliant apparatus evaporates: it has rained.",
  "Kings never touch doors.",
  "They’re not familiar with this happiness: to push, gently or roughly before you one of these great friendly panels, to turn towards it to put it back in place to hold a door in your arms.",
  "The happiness of seizing one of these tall barriers to a room by the porcelain knob of its belly; this quick hand-to-hand, during which your progress slows for a moment, your eye opens up and your whole body adapts to its new apartment.",
  "With a friendly hand you hold on a bit longer, before firmly pushing it back and shutting yourself in of which you are agreeably assured by the click of the powerful, well-oiled latch.",
  "Halfway between crib and cage the French language places crate, a simple slatted box for transporting those fruits that fall ill at the least lack of air.",
  "Built in such a way that it can be broken down effortlessly after use, it is never used twice.",
  "It is really more perishable than the deliquescing foodstuffs that it carries.",
  "On the corners of streets that lead to the markets, it gleams like white wood without wood’s vanity.",
  "Still very new, and slightly surprised to find itself in this awkward position, having been thrown into the gutter without hope of retrieval, it remains a most likable object on whose fate we will not dwell for long.",
  "At dawn the throb of the bombers coming home.",
  "Pull back the curtains, and see how the noiseless fire of sunrise eats down the chestnut trees.",
  "The still chestnut trees with their feet bathed with dew.",
  "There is work to be done, there are friends to be met; today is for laughter, and feet firmly planted on earth, as the dew quivers up into mid-day.",
  "The plate-glass river has caught and transposed the blue of the sky like a theme in music.",
  "Across the morning papers the metal-breasted squadrons engage, the furious tanks articulate with flame and the cannon charge in their hundreds, are burst in a rain of shells.",
  "There are voices proclaiming that heroes have died, that factories roar, that an abracadabra of figures makes triumph certain.",
  "A gruesome sensation: sharks follow a raft of torpedoed seamen for nine days and nights.",
  "Searching among the letters by the coffee-cup for one that still delays.",
  "There are three more posts today.",
  "A strange dream last night about the troop-train.",
  "Was I on my way to some distant front, or returning from the battle?",
  "What country was that half-lit ruined station in?",
  "How clearly I remember those friends of old days, my two companions.",
  "Their warm lips parted they tried to explain to me what was it?",
  "And yet they are a thousand miles away, perhaps in other armies; and if alive, who knows?",
  "But if death comes to me?",
  "Could happen any moment, any night of bombs and fire.",
  "Forget that darkness.",
  "Danger quickens the tide in the veins.",
  "Look, the summer-laden trees, the yellow irises along the wall, are more precious for the thought.",
  "Look with what style the young airmen march the street, and sailors fling the foam of their living into the smiles that greet them.",
  "Being is everything.",
  "There is work to be done.",
  "Telephones will be answered, letters posted, new problems faced like rivers, crossing improvised, achieved.",
  "Skill of hand or eye adorns triumphantly like flowers or medals.",
  "The tide of the day is at the full.",
  "Over the festivals of meat and wine, among the jostling tables, the chances of battle are debated; a new film that opened last night is appraised: a witty story told about a minister.",
  "Repulse, endurance, victory, the hero’s death, all glitter like mist that pearls above a fountain.",
  "But if this is only the scarf with which we hide despair?",
  "But if the pounding of the guns, the plunging of the massed bomb-racks rubs out, not just this house or that, but the whole monument of love and history?",
  "Sands have covered cities, every stone lost and skulls forgotten.",
  "Scattering of yesterday’s friends.",
  "Where are the words of love by the window, all the bubble and excitement round the fire?",
  "Does the web still hold we wove then?",
  "So frail it seems now, stretched to the edge of language by otherness of place and otherness of meaning.",
  "Across the evening paper the squadrons engage, the warships rock in the violent birth of their broadsides.",
  "There are prophets shouting in the wings, a grand transformation scene.",
  "Prophets, magicians, schemers: but the text is blurred.",
  "Is this the promised revolution that will atone for all?",
  "The last rung into sunlight?",
  "Or only an error, the miscarriage of machines?",
  "Does it matter?",
  "Changing is living.",
  "Music seduces, breaking from behind the curtain of a bar.",
  "We are one now, blood flows between us, meeting and parting, the brief exchange of fondness, is music, is singing, in the lights as we crowd by the piano in the bar.",
  "Goodnight, then, goodbye and God bless you.",
  "Let your latchkey into the door, look down eagerly among the scattered letters, the postman’s final visit for the day.",
  "Stamps, inks, envelopes, so many voices speaking up from them; but the longed for accents do not answer.",
  "A great wind is blowing from the centre.",
  "Hearths that were red yesterday are now dead ashes, and the wind blowing through the burst-open windows.",
  "If we hold on: but how much longer?",
  "The bells begin to chime the hour all over the town, recalling the sweetness of centuries, hope stored like honey in the clustered towers.",
  "There was a room once above the street, and your name over the door, and the bells chiming.",
  "But that is already like another life.",
  "There were dreams, there was faith.",
  "We must build.",
  "Come back from the white skulls and sandstorms of Africa, from the murderous teeth of the sea.",
  "Without your laughter confident beside me, without your answering and warm-veined hand, my feet, stepping for the solid earth, find only air.",
  "At dusk, the throb of the bombers going out.",
  "He appeared as I was staring at the lighted coals in my fireplace.",
  "He held in his hands a large box of red matches which he displayed to me like a conjuror taking an egg out of the nose of the person in the next seat.",
  "He struck a match, set fire to the box, disappeared behind an enormous flame, and then stood before me.",
  "I recall his crimson smile and his vitreous eyes.",
  "A hurdy-gurdy in the street went on repeating the same note.",
  "I don’t know how to describe what he was wearing, but he kept making me think of a purple cypress.",
  "Gradually his arms began to separate from his taut body and to form a cross.",
  "Where did so many birds come from?",
  "It was as if he’d had them hidden under his wings.",
  "They flew clumsily, madly, violently, knocking against the walls of the narrow room, against the window-panes, then covered the floor as though wounded.",
  "I felt a warm layer of down and pulsations growing at my feet.",
  "I gazed at him, a strange fever possessed my body like a current coursing through it.",
  "When he’d finished raising his arms and his palms were together, he gave a sudden leap, as if the spring of a watch had broken in front of me.",
  "He knocked against the ceiling, making it echo with the sound of a cymbal, extended his right arm, seized the wire of the lamp, moved slightly, relaxed, then began to describe with his body a figure of eight against the darkness.",
  "The sight made me dizzy and I covered my face with both hands, crushing the darkness against my eyelids, while the hurdy-gurdy went on repeating the same note and then stopped abruptly.",
  "A sudden icy wind struck me; I felt my legs go numb.",
  "Now I also heard the low velvety sound of a flute, followed immediately by a heavy and regular beating.",
  "I opened my eyes and again saw him, standing tiptoe on a crystal sphere in the middle of the room, in his mouth a strange green flute over which he was running his fingers as though there were thousands of them.",
  "The birds now came back to life in an extraordinary order, rose up, mingled, formed into a cortège as wide as my outspread arms, and went out into the night through the window that was somehow open.",
  "When the last flutter had died away and only a suffocating smell of hunting was left, I decided to look him in the face.",
  "There was no face: above the purple body, seemingly headless, he sported a golden mask, of the kind found in Mycenaean tombs, with a pointed beard reaching down to the throat.",
  "I tried to get up, but I’d hardly made the first movement when a cataclysmic sound, like a pile of kettledrums collapsing in a funeral march, rooted me to the spot.",
  "It was the mask.",
  "His face appeared again as I’d originally seen it the eyes, the smile, and something which I now remarked for the first time: the white skin suspended from two black curls that pinned it into place at the temples.",
  "He tried to leap but no longer possessed his initial agility.",
  "I think he even stumbled against a book fallen there by accident, and he knelt down on one knee.",
  "Now I could observe him carefully.",
  "I saw the pores of his skin oozing fine beads of sweat.",
  "Something like breathlessness came over me.",
  "I tried to discover why his eyes had seemed so strange.",
  "He closed them and began to get up; but it must have been terribly difficult, for he seemed to concentrate all his strength without being able to do anything.",
  "He even knelt now on the other knee as well.",
  "The white skin seemed terribly pale, like yellow ivory, and his black hair was lifeless.",
  "Though I was witnessing an agonizing struggle, I had the feeling that I was better, that I’d triumphed over something.",
  "Before I could draw breath I saw him, fallen full length now, plunge into a green pagoda portrayed on my carpet.",
  "Mother, you know there is a place somewhere called Paris.",
  "It’s a huge place and a long way off and it really is huge.",
  "My mother turns up my coat collar, not because it’s starting to snow, but in order that it may start.",
  "My father’s wife is in love with me, walking up, always keeping her back to my birth, and her face toward my death.",
  "Because I am hers twice: by my goodbye and by my coming home.",
  "When I return home, I close her.",
  "That is why her eyes gave me so much, pronounced innocent of me, caught in the act of me, everything occurs through finished arrangements, through covenants carried out.",
  "Has my mother confessed me, has she been named publicly?",
  "Why doesn’t she give so much to my other brothers?",
  "To Victor, for example, the oldest, who is so old now that people say, He looked like his father’s youngest brother.",
  "It must be because I have travelled so much.",
  "It must be because I have lived more.",
  "My mother gives me illuminated permissions to explore my coming-home tales.",
  "Face to face with my returning-home life, remembering that I journeyed for two whole hearts through her womb, she blushes and goes deathly pale when I say in the discourse of the soul: That night I was happy.",
  "But she grows more sad, she grew more sad.",
  "And she walks firmly through the color yellow to cry, because I seem to her to be getting old, on the blade of a sword, in the delta of my face.",
  "Weeps with me, grows sad with me.",
  "Why should my youth be necessary, if I will always be her son?",
  "Why do mothers feel pain when their sons get old, if their age will never equal anyway the age of the mothers?",
  "And why, if the sons, the more they get on, merely come nearer to the age of the fathers?",
  "My mother cries because I am old in my time and because I will never get old enough to be old in hers.",
  "My goodbyes left from a point in her being more toward the outside than the point in her being to which I come back.",
  "I am, because I am so overdue coming back, more the man to my mother than the son to my mother.",
  "The purity that lights us both now with three flames lies precisely in that.",
  "I say then until I finally fall silent: Mother, you know there is this place somewhere called Paris.",
  "It’s a huge place and a long way off and it really is huge.",
  "The wife of my father, hearing my voice, goes on eating her lunch, and her eyes that will die descend gently along my arms.",
  "There once lived a red-headed man who had no eyes or ears.",
  "He also had no hair, so he was only in a manner of speaking called red-haired.",
  "He couldn’t speak, since he had no mouth.",
  "He had no nose either.",
  "He didn’t even have arms or legs.",
  "And he had no stomach, and he had no back, and he had no spine, and he had no innards at all.",
  "He had nothing at all.",
  "So there’s no knowing who we are talking about.",
  "We’d better not talk about him any more.",
  "Floods are frequent because the rivers of Britain have been neglected for a century.",
  "Positive movements of transgression carry the sea and its deposits over the lands, drowning them and their features under tens or hundreds of fathoms of water.",
  "Efforts to advance the prosperity of the country should be directed towards building on the foundations already laid by the native himself, rather than to hazardous introductions or innovations.",
  "Commercial possibilities are not clearly and courageously visualized, and the new ventures are often the product and concern of individuals facing the traditional difficulties of lonely pioneers.",
  "The indoor staff remains comparatively small.",
  "The vigour of mountain building, of volcanoes, and of other manifestations of unrest, has shown no sign of senility or lack of energy.",
  "An operator received concussion and a wound on the head from a cast-iron cover blown off a 60A switch-fuse box.",
  "Geodesists have welcomed escape from the rising and sinking of the crust.",
  "To follow their food from over-grazed or sunscorched regions they required to be able to migrate easily and quickly.",
  "Today you cannot fight summer-heat with haphazard measures.",
  "The fermenting mass is turned three times.",
  "Nevertheless the gates are not kept locked and there is a considerable freedom to the public provided no fires are lighted and respect is shown for the plantations.",
  "Colonel Popham, who began work as a tea planter, murmured, They say a man is too old at forty.",
  "Or is it fifty?",
  "I think it must be seventy or eighty.",
  "I speak four different Chinese dialects fluently.",
  "It helped a lot.",
  "Then the slump came and trade went stagnant.",
  "I have lost all my money, but I can always earn more.",
  "As soon as I have saved up enough I shall put it all into another show.",
  "What is money for?",
  "If it is to be spent it finds work for a lot of people and keeps in circulation.",
  "Our seventy-eight-year-old customer said he had taken the umbrella with him round the world, through jungles and across prairies.",
  "He boasted that he had never lost it because he would never lend it.",
  "He brought it to us to be re-covered.",

  "To meet Him alone on the narrow path, forcing a question, would show our unique knowledge.",

  "Red slippers in a shop-window; and outside in the street, flaws of gray, windy sleet.",
  "Behind the polished glass the slippers hang in long threads of red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding the eyes of passers-by with dripping color, jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars, screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas.",
  "The row of white, sparkling shop-fronts is gashed and bleeding, it bleeds red slippers.",
  "They spout under the electric light, fluid and fluctuating, a hot rain—and freeze again to red slippers, myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window.",
  "They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets.",
  "Snap, snap, they are cracker sparks of scarlet in the white, monotonous block of shops.",
  "They plunge the clangor of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement.",
  "People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window farther down is a big lotus bud of cardboard, whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair.",
  "One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before?",
  "The flaws of gray, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where there are only red slippers.",
  "I love you would have no application for the moment.",
  "I love you waits with cold wings furled, stands a cold angel shut up like cherry-buds; cherry-buds not yet half in blossom.",

  "It would tear down the walls of the city and abstract right and grace from the frozen image that might have right and grace painted upon its collar bones.",
  "The Image has no right decoration for the moment, is swathed in foreign and barbaric garments, is smothered out in the odd garments of its strange and outlandish disproportion.",
  "The Nordic image that stands and is cold and has that high mark of queen-grace upon its Nordic forehead is dying.",
  "It is dying, its buds are infolded.",
  "If once the light of the sheer beauty of the Initiate could strike its features, it would glow like rare Syrian gold; the workmanship of the East would have to be astonishingly summoned to invent new pattern of palm branch, new decoration of pine-bud and the cone of the Nordic pine that the Eastern workman would so appropriately display twined with the Idaian myrtle.",
  "The Idaian myrtle would be shot with the enamel of the myrtle-blue that alone among workmen, the Idaian workmen fashioned in glass and in porphyry, stained to fit separate occasion and the right and perfect slicing of the rose-quartz from the Egyptian quarry.",
  "The Nordic Image is my Image and alone of all Images I would make it suitable so that the South should not laugh, so that the West should be stricken, so that the East should fall down, bearing its scented baskets of spice-pink and little roses.",
  "Flowers fall, unreasonable, out of space and counter point of time beaten by the metronome of year and year, century on century.",
  "The metronome is wound up, will go on, go on beating for our life span; a metronome tick of year, year, year; life for life; heart beat on heart beat, beats the metronome holding us to the music that is the solid rhythm of the scale of the one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, I am here, you are there; tell me I am here and I will tell you, you are there; but the metronome ticks a metronome music and the voice flinging its challenge to all music in the teeth of Reason stays for no tick, tick; the heart that springs to the feet of Love with all unreason, stays no moment to listen to the human tick and tick of the human metronome heart-beat.",
  "Heart you are beating, heart you are beating, I am afraid to measure my heart beat by your heart beat for I am afraid with the shame of a child struck across fingers by the master that says play soft, play loud, play one-two-three-four again, again.",
  "I am struck across the fingers and across the mouth.",
  "My mouth aches with the unutterable insult of one-two-three-four.",
  "Why can’t I cry out, fall at your feet or you at my feet, one or the other overcome by the beauty of the metronome whose beauty is unassailable, or overwhelmed, overcome by the fragrance, dripped, ripped, sputtered, spread or split.",
  "Voiceless, without a voice, seeking areas of consciousness without you.",
  "Seeking with you areas of consciousness that without you would no more be plausible.",
  "Set up choros against acted drama, the high boot, the gilt wreath of ivy for some dramatic deity; set him forth, crown him with pasteboard pomegranates.",
  "Pasteboard pomegranates have nothing to do with this reality.",
  "Out of the air, into the air, the colour flames and there is pulse of thyme, fire-blue that leads me across a slab of white-hot marble.",
  "My feet burn there and the wet garment clings so that I am a nymph risen from white water.",
  "So you overseeing, burn into my flesh until my bones are burnt through and attacking the marrow of my singular bone-structure, you light the flame that makes me cry toward Delphi.",
  "Were pasteboard pomegranates of any worth or plums stitched on to a paper crown?",
  "Men recounted your valour, shut you up in strophes, collected you in pages whose singular letters are still laced across your spirit.",
  "The Greek letters are an arabesque shutting you in, away, away; you are shut in from the eyes that read Greek letters.",
  "Take away the gold and manifest chryselephantine of your manifest decoration and you are left.",
  "Seeping into wine-vats, creeping under closed doors, lying beside me.",
  "As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill.",
  "I was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles.",
  "An elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty green iron table, saying: If the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden.",
  "I decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might be collected, and I concentrated my attention with careful subtlety to this end.",
  "Her soul is like a little thrust-tailed dog that follows her, whimpering.",
  "She is large enough, I know, to find a warm spot for it.",
  "But each night when she comes home and closes the big outside storm door, the little dog is left in the vestibule, filled with chills till morning.",
  "Soft as a cotton boll brushed against the milk-pod cheek of Christ, will steal in and cover it that it need not shiver, and carry it to her where she sleeps upon clean hay cut in her dreams.",
  "When you meet her in the daytime on the streets, the little dog keeps coming.",
  "Nothing happens at first, and then, when she has forgotten the streets and alleys, and the large house where she goes to bed of nights, a soft thing like fur begins to rub your limbs, and you hear a low, scared voice, lonely, calling, and you know that a cool something nozzles moisture in your palms.",
  "Sensitive things like nostrils, quiver.",
  "Her breath comes sweet as honeysuckle whose pistils bear the life of coming song.",
  "And her eyes carry to where builders find no need for vestibules, for swinging on iron hinges, storm doors.",
  "Her soul is like a little thrust-tailed dog, that follows her, whimpering.",
  "I’ve seen it tagging on behind her, up streets where chestnut trees flowered, where dusty asphalt had been freshly sprinkled with clean water.",
  "Up alleys where niggers sat on low door-steps before tumbled shanties and sang and loved.",
  "At night, when she comes home, the little dog is left in the vestibule, nosing the crack beneath the big storm door, filled with chills till morning.",
  "Soft as the bare feet of Christ moving across bales of southern cotton, will steal in and cover it that it need not shiver, and carry it to her where she sleeps: cradled in dream-fluted cane.",
  "In the Italian quarter of London I found a group of clerks, waiters and idealistic barbers calling itself The Rosicrucian Mysteries, Soho Chapter, that met to read papers on the fabrication of gold and its metaphysical implications, to elect from its number certain Arch-adepts and magistri hieraticorum, to correspond with the last of the magi, Orzinda-mazda, on Mt.",
  "Sinai, and to retell, wide-eyed, their stories of how some workmen near Rome, breaking by chance into the tomb of Cicero’s daughter, Tulliola, discovered an everburning lamp suspended in mid-air, its wick feeding on Perpetual Principle; of how Cleopatra’s son Caesarion was preserved in a translucent liquid, oil of gold, and could be still seen in an underground shrine at Vienna; and of how Virgil never died, but was alive still on the Island of Patmos, eating the leaves of a peculiar tree.",
  "In Rome I encountered a number of people who for one reason or another were unable to sleep between midnight and dawn, and when I tossed sleepless, or when I returned late to my rooms through the deserted streets—at the hour when the parricide feels a cat purring about his feet in the darkness—I pictured to myself old Baldassare in the Borgo, former Bishop of Shantung and Apostolic Visitor to the Far East, rising at two to study with streaming eyes the Fathers and the Councils, marvelling, he said, at the continuous blooming of the rose-tree of Doctrine; or of Stasia, a Russian refugee who had lost the habit of sleeping after dark during her experience as nurse in the War, Stasia playing solitaire through the night and brooding over the jocose tortures to which her family had been subjected by the soldiers of Taganrog; and of Elizabeth Grier who, like some German prince of the Eighteenth Century, owned her own band of musicians, listening the length over her long shadowed room to some new work that D’Indy had sent her, or bending over the score while her little troupe revived the overture to Les Indes Galantes.",
  "Let us strip the desk for action—now we have a horse in Mexico.",
  "That night in Vera Cruz—verily for me the True Cross—let us remember the Doctor and my thoughts, my humble, fond remembrances of the great bacteriologist.",
  "The wind that night, the clamour of incessant shutters, trundle doors, and the cherub watchman—tiptoeing the successive patio balconies with a typical pistol—trying to muffle doors—and the pharos shine—the mid-wind midnight stroke of it, its milk-light regularity above my bath partition through the lofty, dusty glass—Cortez—Cortez—his crumbled palace in the square—the typhus in a trap, the Doctor’s rat trap.",
  "Somewhere in Vera Cruz—to bring—to take—to mix—to ransom—to deduct—to cure.",
  "The rats played ring around the rosy in their basement basinette—the Doctor supposedly slept, supposedly in #35—thus in my wakeful watches at least—the lighthouse flashed.",
  "Delayed, and struck—again, again.",
  "Only the Mayans surely slept—whose references to typhus and whose records spurred the Doctor into something nigh those metaphysics that are typhoid plus and had engaged him once before to death’s beyond and back again—antagonistic wills—into immunity.",
  "Tact, horsemanship, courage were germicides to him.",
  "Poets may not be doctors, but doctors are rare poets when roses leap like rats—and too, when rats make rose nozzles of pink death around white teeth.",
  "And during the wait over dinner at La Diana the Doctor had said—who was American, also—You cannot heed the negative—so might go on to undeserved doom.",

  "No matter that he’d been a eunuch, and had succumbed in early childhood: I did it, I shaved him.",
  "Then they told me to burn a village; next, a fair-sized town; then, a city; a bigger city; a small, down-at-heels country; then one of the great powers; then another another, another—In fact, they went right on until they’d told me to burn up every man-made thing on the face of the earth.",
  "And I did it, I burned away every last trace, I left nothing, nothing of any kind whatever.",

  "Be delighted with something.",
  "Yesterday for me it was watching sun on stones; wet stones.",
  "I spent the morning lost in the wonder of that.",
  "A delight of god’s size.",
  "The gods never saw anything more enchanting than that.",
  "The sun on wet stones.",
  "But today what delights me is thinking of bluepink flowers.",
  "Not that I’ve seen any.",
  "Actually there isn’t a flower of any kind in the house. —Except in my head.",
  "But, my friend, oh my friend.",
  "What wonderful bluepink flowers.",
  "Delight in my bluepink flowers.",
  "The same voluble fellow again—such is your speech with yourself, I suppose, upon seeing me again, though this time in a dress suit with a top hat as if to appeal to the snob and fop in every man, or at least to the upper-class sentiments in all of the lower and middle class.",
  "What a buttonholing mariner.",
  "What a jack-in-the-box I am, but truly with a decent motive—to entertain, to be useful—and also to arrive at a point.",
  "I do not actually know, except that there must be a point and when I get there I will recognize it, though I scarcely expect to get there very soon, and one who did would equal all the seven wonders of nature of the ancients—the camel, the rainbow, the echo, the cuckoo, the Negro, the volcano, and the sirocco.",
  "I have been thinking about justice.",
  "Naturally: look at what surrounds us.",
  "Justice: a fine word and immediately suggesting how beautiful a thing the fact must be, if there is such a fact, either possible or actual.",
  "A round, complete, self-contained datum, like an enormous globe radiating a dazzling light which illuminates every corner, subterfuge, and mystery between human beings, not creating, as the sun does being like all natural things involved in the dialectic of nature so many morbid shadows, and the black broom of night at once with the bright bloom of day.",
  "What could I think of, desiring to amuse as well as instruct, also to be pleased and to learn myself—of what but the ancient short story made known to me in childhood by my crippled father, a brief history which has prepossessed me to this day, even with the archness in which my poor father attempted to hide the essential viciousness and despair of the narrative.",
  "Once upon a time, said my father, seated in his wheel chair, and summoning unknowingly in that traditional opening the continuous present necessary to the interest of any story, Once upon a time, he repeated, an old farmer named Schrecklichkeitunendlich a name chosen to tickle me and his young son Hans, aged ten, went to town taking with them their brown pony named Ego.",
  "That is a strange name for a pony or anyone else.",
  "No, no, said my bitter father, it is a well-known name.",
  "I have never heard of anyone with that name, I said stubbornly.",
  "Please, said my father, angered, if you continue to interrupt me, I will never finish the story, which you begged me to tell you.",
  "Father, son, and pony, my father continued, started for the market place, and Hans rode the pony.",
  "It was a beautiful blue-and-gold day in the month of June, and all three were pleased with all things, the father because he was going to sell the pony and with the proceeds buy a gun with which to kill deer, the son because he had been promised a pair of boxing gloves by the father, and the pony merely glad because he was exercising himself and the weather was fine.",
  "The three travelers had gone but a mile—the town being four miles distant—when a man with a whip came along from the opposite direction, and seeing them, said indignantly: O pitiless boy.",
  "You who are young and strong ride the pony, while your father, the weak old man, walks beside you and by such exertion shortens his days.",
  "Get down from the pony, let your father ride, honor your father, remember his weakness.",
  "Intimidated by this, father and son said nothing, the traveler went on his way absentmindedly, Hans dismounted, and his father mounted the pony.",
  "But they should have had two ponies, I said to my father.",
  "They had only one, my father replied.",
  "The number of ponies is not infinite.",
  "Many people have only one pony, and as for us, as you know, we have none, said my father in his embittered voice and continued.",
  "They went forward another mile and another stranger approached, holding a gun in his hand, stopped them, took the pony by the halter, standing there as if he were an official authority: Evil old man, he said.",
  "The young boy must walk while the father rides, as if he were a king and would like to live forever.",
  "A king, Father?",
  "Kings do not live forever.",
  "No one does.",
  "By king, I meant an important person, he said annoyed and impatient.",
  "Do not, please, interrupt me so often.",
  "The stranger stood there so threateningly that the father dismounted.",
  "Satisfied, the stranger passed on, leaving father and son completely perplexed, not knowing at all what to do.",
  "Suddenly Hans was inspired: Father, Father.",
  "We will both ride the pony.",
  "The father saw how intelligent this idea was and said with pride: Hans, you are a smart boy, and soon both were mounted on the pony and jogging toward town.",
  "The pony’s pace slowed up a bit, but not otherwise did he show himself troubled by the additional weight.",
  "But soon a third stranger came along, saw them and stopped them.",
  "This one brandished a sword and said, in a tone of the greatest moral indignation and self-righteousness: O heartless humans.",
  "Both of you riding one weak and young pony.",
  "What ruthless cruelty toward the dumb and inoffensive beast.",
  "Dismount before you kill him, or I will report you to both the civil and sacred authorities.",
  "Both father and son dismounted hurriedly, and clumsily for it is difficult for two to dismount from a horse at the same time.",
  "Something is always wrong, said the father aloud, as he dismounted and the stranger, satisfied, departed.",
  "Hans, said the father, we will both walk and the pony will walk beside us.",
  "Then perhaps all will be content.",
  "No sooner had he said this than a fourth stranger appeared.",
  "Hans drew back and wished to hide in the wood until the stranger passed, especially since the newcomer carried a whip, and a gun, and a sword.",
  "But the father decided against hiding.",
  "What is wrong with you?",
  "Said the stranger in a voice whose kindliness stunned them with surprise.",
  "Why don’t you ride the pony?",
  "Why are you so stupid?",
  "What is a pony for, if not to ride?",
  "Then the stranger passed on, before they could tell him of the difficulties involved in riding the pony.",
  "Desperate by this time, the farmer said: Son, only one choice remains.",
  "If either of us ride the pony, we will remain at the mercy of these denunciations of the first, second, and third class.",
  "We must carry the pony, then perhaps all sides will be satisfied.",
  "The pony may not like it, Father.",
  "He is silent.",
  "If he says anything, we will whip him.",
  "And so they lifted the pony on their backs, although it was a difficult and clumsy thing to do.",
  "Father, I said at this point, in disbelief, you are inventing this story.",
  "You ought not to tell me falsehoods.",
  "No one carries a pony upon his back.",
  "That is ridiculous.",
  "My father was greatly angered and slapped me savagely, making me howl with pain.",
  "Don’t ever call your father a liar, he said.",
  "It’s enough that your mother does so.",
  "Finish the story, Father, please, I said meekly, weeping.",
  "After a slow and painful effort, the farmer and Hans managed to reach the market place, carrying the pony upon their backs and looking very strange.",
  "In the market place, idlers were congregated, who, when they saw this sight, began to laugh and their laughter increased in intensity and volume.",
  "What are you good-for-nothings laughing about?",
  "Said the father, challenging them, while Hans in shame hid his head in his father’s sleeve.",
  "The leader, the biggest wiseacre of all, answered: Why, you damned fool.",
  "Whoever heard of carrying a pony?",
  "A pony is supposed to carry you.",
  "Their laughter increased still more at this sally, and the farmer felt completely helpless—at the end of his rope—and besides he could not stand being laughed at, being very sensitive.",
  "So he took out his revolver, which he had had in his pocket all the while, and—bang.",
  "Bang. —shot the pony, shot his son, and, shrugging his shoulders, and brushing the hair back from his forehead, shot himself.",
  "My mother entered at this moment and began to argue with my father for telling the child such a story, and soon all the hate between them made each bring up past wrongs on each other’s part, and in their heat they forgot my presence and spoke shamelessly and brutally, while I wept loudly, watching them, weeping because of the sad end of the story, because they were denouncing each other and because I had been slapped for calling my father a liar.",
  "I sink back upon the ground, expecting to die.",
  "A voice speaks out of my ear, You are not going to die, you are being changed into a zebra.",
  "You will have black and white stripes up and down your back and you will love people as you do not now.",
  "That is why you will be changed into a zebra that people will tame and exhibit in a zoo.",
  "You will be a favorite among children and you will love the children in return whom you do not love now.",
  "Zoo keepers will make a pet of you because of your round, sad eyes and musical bray, and you will love your keeper as you do not now.",
  "All is well, then, I tell myself silently, listening to the voice in my ear speak to me of my future.",
  "And what will happen to you, voice in my ear, I ask silently, and the answer comes at once: I will be your gentle, musical bray that will help you as a zebra all your days.",
  "I will mediate between the world and you, and I will learn to love you as a zebra whom I did not love as a human being.",
  "The apple I held and bit into was for me.",
  "The friend who spoke to me was for me.",
  "My father and mother were for me.",
  "The little girl with brown hair and brown eyes who looked and smiled shyly and ran away was for me, although I never dared follow her because I feared she would not understand that she was for me alone.",
  "The bed I slept in was for me.",
  "The clothes I wore were for me.",
  "The kindness I showed a dead bird one winter by placing it in my warm pocket was for me.",
  "The time I went to the rescue of my sister from a bully was to prove myself, for me.",
  "The music on the radio, the books I was beginning to read, all were for me.",
  "I had hold of a good thing, me, and I was going to give of my contentment to others, for me, and when I gave, it was taken with a smile that I recognized as mine, when I would be given.",
  "I had found that for me was everybody’s way, and I became anxious and uncertain.",
  "I held back a bit when I exchanged post card pictures of baseball players, with a close look at what I was getting in return to make sure I was getting what I could like, and when my parents bought me a new pair of gloves after I had lost the first pair I was sure that for me was not as pure in feeling as the first time, because I was very sorry that my parents had to spend an extra dollar to replace my lost gloves, and so when I looked up at the night stars, for me remained silent, and when my grandmother died, for me became a little boy sent on an errand of candles to place at the foot and head of her coffin.",
  "He believed if the woman on the right moved over to the left he could place her into the frame where a meadow lay beyond her.",
  "But it did not work out that way.",

  "The girl’s knee is supposed to be grey when she bends it, not the color of blood.",
  "The voice coming from the elderberries is colorless, indicating melancholy.",
  "He remembers the alluring depths in film without color when tears were dark as drops falling from a raven’s mouth.",
  "Once again his efforts have been emptied of meaning.",
  "Gladioli slant in the border as though stuck not growing there and around the square white wood beehive the bees drone like the layers of a bulb at the center of which is a viscous shoot.",
  "Small green apples hang from the small trees and under the skinny boughs ducks a skinny boy in wool swim trunks steering a lawn mower.",
  "Damp blades of chopped off grass and clover leaves stick to his shins.",

  "The gravel spurts under the wheels of a car, which, coming from between the lilac hedges, discloses itself as a laundry truck.",

  "For Anne Waldman July 23, 1969 I, I mused, yes, I, and turned to the fenestrations of the night beyond one of Ada and Alex Katz’s windows.",
  "Deep in Prince Street lurked thin sullen fumes of Paris green; some great spotty Danes moved from room to room, their tails went whack whack in a kindly way and their mouths were full of ruses roses.",
  "Flames in red glass pots, unlikely flowers, a spot of light that jumped Don’t fret back and forth over a strip of moulding, the kind of moulding that spells low class dwelling—I, I mused, take no interest in the distinction between amateur and pro, and despise the latter a little less each year.",
  "The spot of light, reflected off a cup of strong blue coffee, wasn’t getting anywhere but it wasn’t standing still.",
  "They say a lot of gangsters mothers live around here, so the streets are safe.",
  "A vast and distant school building made chewing noises in its sleep.",
  "Our Lady of someplace stood up in a wood niche with lots and lots of dollar bills pinned around her.",
  "The night was hot, everybody went out in the street and sold each other hot sausages and puffy sugared farinaceous products fried in deep fat Don’t put your fingers in that, dear while the band played and the lady in the silver fox scarf with the beautiful big crack in her voice sang about the young man and how he ran out in front of the stock exchange and drank a bottle of household ammonia: Ungrateful Heart.",

  "A friend of mine, a woman, once explained happiness to me.",
  "We were sitting in the Place de la République in Paris, an unlikely spot for happiness.",
  "We were tired, had walked a lot, had sat down at a large, generic big-square café.",
  "Dear though it may be to its proprietors and its habitués, it seemed ordinary enough to us.",

  "After two swallows of the beer, I was overcome by a feeling of happiness.",
  "I told her and I told her again about it later.",
  "She had a theory about a happiness base.",

  "That’s why you were happy at the café.",
  "Kawabata asked my acquaintance in turn: How would you define happiness?",
  "He told me his answer: I said How can anyone answer a question like that?",
  "The blossoming cherry trees were quarreling.",
  "She thought this when she was fifty yards away and when she was closer, right in amongst them, she imagined she heard them.",
  "One tree said to another: I am prettier than you.",
  "And the other said: It is impossible for you to see yourself.",
  "But I see you.",
  "And I tell you you’re wrong.",
  "The first tree disputed the illogic of this remark.",
  "And so on.",
  "She went on walking, and when she came out of the cherry grove, she had been through a lot.",
  "She hated quarreling.",
  "Dietrich was standing by his boat.",
  "Come, can you go out with me?",
  "I don’t want to quarrel, she said.",
  "He didn’t understand.",
  "Well, will you or not?",

  "My wife came in from the kitchen.",
  "Lunch is ready, she said.",

  "The Hockey PoemThe Boston College team has gold helmets, under which the long black hair of the Roman centurion curls out.",
  "And they begin.",
  "How weird the goalies look with their African masks.",
  "The goalie is so lonely anyway, guarding a basket with nothing in it, his wide lower legs wide as ducks’.",
  "No matter what gift he is given, he always rejects it.",
  "He has a number like 1, a name like Mrazek, sometimes wobbling on his legs waiting for the puck, or curling up like a baby in the womb to hold it, staying a second too long on the ice.",
  "The goalie has gone out to mid-ice, and now he sails sadly back to his own box, slowly; he looks prehistoric with his rhinoceros legs; he looks as if he’s going to become extinct, and he’s just taking his time.",
  "When the players are at the other end, he begins sadly sweeping the ice in front of his house; he is the old witch in the woods, waiting for the children to come home.",
  "They all come hurrying back toward us, suddenly, knees dipping like oil wells; they rush toward us wildly, fins waving, they are pike swimming toward us, their gill fins expanding like the breasts of opera singers; no, they are twelve hands practicing penmanship on the same piece of paper.",
  "They flee down the court toward us like birds, swirling two and two, hawks hurrying for the mouse, hurrying down wind valleys, swirling back and forth like amoebae on the pale slide, as they sail in the absolute freedom of water and the body, untroubled by the troubled mind, only the body, with wings as if there were no grave, no gravity, only the birds sailing over the cottage far in the deep woods.",
  "Now the goalie is desperate.",
  "He looks wildly over his left shoulder, rushing toward the other side of his cave, like a mother hawk whose chicks are being taken by two snakes.",
  "Suddenly he flops on the ice like a man trying to cover a whole double bed.",
  "He has the puck.",
  "He stands up, turns to his right, and drops it on the ice at the right moment; he saves it for one of his children, a mother hen picking up a seed and then dropping it.",
  "But the men are all too clumsy, they can’t keep track of the puck.",
  "No, it is the puck, the puck is too fast, too fast for human beings, it humiliates them constantly.",
  "The players are like country boys at the fair watching the con man—The puck always turns up under the wrong walnut shell.",
  "They come down ice again, one man guiding the puck this time.",
  "And Ledingham comes down beautifully, like the canoe through white water, or the lover going upstream, every stroke right, like the stallion galloping up the valley surrounded by his mares and colts, how beautiful, like the body and soul crossing in a poem.",
  "The player in position pauses, aims, pauses, cracks his stick on the ice, and a cry as the puck goes in.",
  "The goalie stands up disgusted, and throws the puck out.",
  "The player with a broken stick hovers near the cage.",
  "When the play shifts, he skates over to his locked-in teammates, who look like a nest of bristling owls, owl babies, and they hold out a stick to him.",
  "Then the players crash together, their hockey sticks raised like lobster claws.",
  "They fight with slow motions, as if undersea.",
  "They are fighting over some woman back in the motel, but like lobsters they forget what they’re battling for; the clack of the armor plate distracts them, and they feel a pure rage.",
  "Or a fighter sails over to the penalty box, where ten-year-old boys wait to sit with the criminal, who is their hero.",
  "They know society is wrong, the wardens are wrong, the judges hate individuality.",
  "And this man with his peaked mask, with slits, how fantastic he is, like a white insect who has given up on evolution in this life; his family hopes to evolve after death, in the grave.",
  "He is ominous as a Dark Ages knight.",
  "The Black Prince.",
  "His enemies defeated him in the day, but every one of them died in their beds that night.",
  "At his father’s funeral, he carried his own head under his arm.",
  "He is the old woman in the shoe, whose house is never clean, no matter what she does.",
  "Perhaps this goalie is not a man at all, but a woman, all women; in her cage everything disappears in the end; we all long for it.",
  "All these movements on the ice will end, the seats will come down, the stadium walls bare.",
  "This goalie with his mask is a woman weeping over the children of men, that are cut down like grass, gulls that stand with cold feet on the ice.",
  "And at the end, she is still waiting, brushing away before the leaves, waiting for the new children developed by speed, by war.",
  "Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean.",
  "Standing inside, we see around us, coming in through the cracks between shrunken wall boards, bands or strips of sunlight.",
  "So in a poem about imprisonment, one sees a little light.",
  "But how many birds have died trapped in these granaries.",
  "The bird, seeing freedom in the light, flutters up the walls and falls back again and again.",
  "The way out is where the rats enter and leave; but the rat’s hole is low to the floor.",
  "Writers, be careful then by showing the sunlight on the walls not to promise the anxious and panicky blackbirds a way out.",
  "I say to the reader, beware.",
  "Readers who love poems of light may sit hunched in the corner with nothing in their gizzards for four days, light failing, the eyes glazed.",
  "They may end as a mound of feathers and a skull on the open boardwood floor.",
  "Someone has stepped on this tin can, which now has the shape of a broken cheekbone.",
  "It has developed a Franciscan color out in the desert, perhaps some monk who planted apple trees in the absent pastures, near the graveyard of his friends.",
  "The can’s texture is rough and reminds one of Rommel’s neck.",
  "When the fingers touch it, they inquire if it is light or heavy.",
  "It is both light and heavy like Mrs. Mongrain’s novel we just found in the attic, written seventy years ago.",
  "None of the characters are real but in any case they’re all dead now.",
  "Here we are at Whitehorse Key.",

  "Now they can look down and see the helpless shining fish once more.",
  "The day has gone by; it is early dusk.",
  "The sun is setting down through a neighboring island.",
  "We see dark ragged lines of trees, braced behind shiny, coppery water, given a momentary further darkness by a leaping fish, given broad strokes of murder by a pelican lumbering shoreward, then diving with a splash like a car wreck, rising cradling a fish in his bill, and so emerging triumphant.",
  "Just before dark, the rosy band left by the setting sun begins to evaporate.",
  "The sun disk is gone, leaving behind the solitary, funereal, obscure, Jesuitical, cloud-reflecting, cloud-worshipping, altar-mad, boat-strewn Florida waters.",
  "What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.",

  "I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops?",
  "What price bananas?",
  "Are you my Angel?",
  "I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.",
  "We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.",
  "Where are we going, Walt Whitman?",
  "The doors close in an hour.",
  "Which way does your beard point tonight?",
  "I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.",
  "Will we walk all night through solitary streets?",
  "The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we’ll both be lonely.",
  "Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?",
  "Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?",

  "Years of this have tanned and shriveled the boatmen.",
  "For after all, the truly exhilarating bits were few, far between —boulders goaded past, dumb beasts mantled in glass-green gush—and patently led where but to the landing, the bridge, the crowds.",
  "We step ashore, in our clumsiness hoping not to spill these brief impressions.",
  "At its threshold we sit on our heels, the only audience.",
  "Pure bell notes, rosaries rattled like dice before the throw.",
  "Some young priests—the same who received us yesterday, showed us to our rooms, served our meal, woke us in time for these matins—surround a candlelit bower of bliss.",
  "The abbot briskly enters, takes his place, and leads them in deep, monotonous chant.",
  "His well-fed back is to us.",
  "He faces a small gold pagoda flanked by big gold lotus trees overhung by tinkling pendants of gold.",
  "Do such arrangements please a blackened image deep within?",
  "To us they look like Odette’s first drawing room before Swann takes charge of her taste lit up for a party, or the Maison Dorée he imagines as the scene of her infidelities.",
  "Still, when the abbot turns, and with a gesture invites us to place incense upon the brazier already full of warm, fragrant ash, someone—myself perhaps—tries vainly to hold back a queer sob.",

  "Why couldn’t the rest be?",
  "A homophone deepens the trope.",
  "Surrendering to Earth’s colors, shall we not be Earth before we know it?",
  "Venerated therefore is the skill which, prior to immersion, inflicts upon a sacrificial length of crêpe de Chine certain intricate knottings no hue can touch.",
  "So that one fine day, painstakingly unbound, this terminal gooseflesh, the fable’s whole eccentric star-puckered moral— white, never-to-blossom buds of the mountain laurel— may be read as having emerged triumphant from the vats of night.",
  "Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde?",
  "Or religious as if I were French?",
  "Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list. , but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.",
  "Why should I share you?",
  "Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?",
  "I am the least difficult of men.",
  "All I want is boundless love.",
  "Even trees understand me.",
  "Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I?",
  "I’m just like a pile of leaves.",
  "However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures.",
  "One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life.",
  "It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass.",
  "Do they know what they’re missing?",
  "My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me.",
  "I am always looking away.",
  "Or again at something after it has given me up.",
  "It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still.",
  "If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something.",
  "It’s not that I’m curious.",
  "On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth.",
  "And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.",
  "Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven.",
  "You are inexorably approaching.",
  "How discourage her?",
  "St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky.",
  "How am I to become a legend, my dear?",
  "I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the ecstasy of always bursting forth.",
  "But one must not be distracted by it.",
  "Or like a hyacinth, to keep the filth of life away, yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines.",
  "I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.",
  "Destroy yourself, if you don’t know.",
  "It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so.",

  "Or F: B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whipping and 10, 000 pounds. —Mrs. Thrale.",
  "I’ve got to get out of here.",
  "I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans.",
  "I’ll be back, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to.",
  "It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead.",
  "There won’t be any mail downstairs.",
  "Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.",
  "In a fever of style, having slaughtered the false Florimells of harmonious thought and their turgid convincements, he marshalled lightning and the beautiful stench of signed clouds.",
  "Some sneered: him a silly Quixote.",
  "But he laid waste Central Europe and painted with the salt of Jenghiz the wounds of World War I.",
  "Not enough women rubbed their breasts against trees while waiting for big nightingales, so he pushed these ladies, intelligent refugees from Weimar, into a Pierrotless sea, and everywhere the frontiers of a sensibility whose left foot was only then fearfully emerging trembled like the rim of the sun under his hot clothes.",
  "The classic grace of a spirit resting on broken glass informed the shell of his virgin Muse with pink echoes from the newspapers, at the mercy of every fresh breath from the tradewinds.",
  "The cross-hatching technique which allowed our ancestors to exchange certain genetic traits for others, in order to provide their offspring with a way of life at once more variegated and more secure than their own, has just about run out of steam and has left us wondering, once more, what there is about this plush solitude that makes us think we will ever get out, or even want to.",
  "The ebony hands of the clock always seem to mark the same hour.",
  "That is why it always seems the same, though it is of course changing constantly, subtly, as though fed by an underground stream.",
  "If only we could go out in back, as when we were kids, and smoke and fool around and just stay out of the way, for a little while.",
  "But that’s just it—don’t you see?",
  "We are out in back.",
  "No one has ever used the front door.",
  "We have always lived in this place without a name, without shame, a place for grownups to talk and laugh, having a good time.",
  "When we were children it seemed that adulthood would be like climbing a tree, that there would be a view from there, breathtaking because slightly more elusive.",
  "But now we can see only down, first down through the branches and further down the surprisingly steep grass patch that slopes away from the base of the tree.",
  "It certainly is a different view, but not the one we expected.",
  "What did they want us to do?",
  "Stand around this way, monitoring every breath, checking each impulse for the return address, wondering constantly about evil until necessarily we fall into a state of torpor that is probably the worst sin of all?",
  "To what purpose did they cross-hatch so effectively, so that the luminous surface that was underneath is transformed into another, also luminous but so shifting and so alive with suggestiveness that it is like quicksand, to take a step there would be to fall through the fragile net of uncertainties into the bog of certainty, otherwise known as the Slough of Despond?",
  "Probably they meant for us to enjoy the things they enjoyed, like late summer evenings, and hoped that we’d find others and thank them for providing us with the wherewithal to find and enjoy them.",
  "Singing the way they did, in the old time, we can sometimes see through the tissues and tracings the genetic process has laid down between us and them.",
  "The tendrils can suggest a hand; or a specific color—the yellow of the tulip, for instance—will flash for a moment in such a way that after it has been withdrawn we can be sure that there was no imagining, no auto-suggestion here, but at the same time it becomes as useless as all subtracted memories.",
  "It has brought certainty without heat or light.",
  "Yet still in the old time, in the faraway summer evenings, they must have had a word for this, or known that we would someday need one, and wished to help.",
  "Then it is that a kind of purring occurs, like the wind sneaking around the baseboards of a room: not the infamous still, small voice but an ancillary speech that is parallel to the slithering of our own doubt-fleshed imaginings, a visible soundtrack of the way we sound as we move from encouragement to despair to exasperation and back again, with a gesture sometimes that is like an aborted movement outward toward some cape or promontory from which the view would extend in two directions—backward and forward—but that is only a polite hope in the same vein as all the others, crumpled and put away, and almost not to be distinguished from any of them, except that it knows we know, and in the context of not knowing is a fluidity that flashes like silver, that seems to say a film has been exposed and an image will, most certainly will, not like the last time, come to consider itself within the frame.",
  "It must be an old photograph of you, out in the yard, looking almost afraid in the crisp, raking light that afternoons in the city held in those days, unappeased, not accepting anything from anybody.",
  "So what else is new?",
  "I’ll tell you what is: you are accepting this now from the invisible, unknown sender, and the light that was intended, you thought, only to rake or glance is now directed full in your face, as it in fact always was, but you were squinting so hard, fearful of accepting it, that you didn’t know this.",
  "Whether it warms or burns is another matter, which we will not go into here.",
  "The point is that you are accepting it and holding on to it, like love from someone you always thought you couldn’t stand, and whom you now recognize as a brother, an equal.",
  "Someone whose face is the same as yours in the photograph but who is someone else, all of whose thoughts and feelings are directed at you, falling like a gentle slab of light that will ultimately loosen and dissolve the crusted suspicion, the timely self-hatred, the efficient cold directness, the horrible good manners, the sensible resolves and the senseless nights spent waiting in utter abandon, that have grown up to be you in the tree with no view; and place you firmly in the good-natured circle of your ancestors games and entertainments.",
  "To be involved in every phase of directing, acting, producing and so on must be infinitely rewarding.",
  "Just as when a large, fat, lazy frog hops off his lily pad like a spitball propelled by a rubber band and disappears into the water of the pond with an enthusiastic plop.",
  "It cannot be either changed or improved on.",
  "So too with many of life’s little less-than-pleasurable experiences, like the rain that falls and falls for so long that no one can remember when it began or what weather used to be, or cares much either; they are much too busy trying to plug holes in ceilings or emptying pails and other containers and then quickly pushing them back to catch the overflow.",
  "But nobody seems eager to accord ideal status to this situation and I, for one, would love to know why.",
  "Don’t we realize that after all these centuries that are now starting to come apart like moldy encyclopedias in some abandoned, dusty archive that we have to take the bitter with the sweet or soon all distinctions will be submerged by the tide of tepid approval of everything that is beginning to gather force and direction as well?",
  "And when its mighty roar threatens in earnest the partially submerged bridges and cottages, picks up the floundering cattle to deposit them in trees and so on to who knows what truly horrible mischief, it will be time, then, to genuinely rethink this and come up with true standards of evaluation, only it will be too late of course, too late for anything but the satisfaction that lasts only just so long.",
  "A pity, though.",
  "Meanwhile I lift my glass to these black-and-silver striped nights.",
  "I believe that the rain never drowned sweeter, more prosaic things than those we have here, now, and I believe this is going to have to be enough.",
  "I have a friendly disposition but am forgetful, though I tend to forget only important things.",
  "Several mornings ago I was lying in my bed listening to a sound of leisurely hammering coming from a nearby building.",
  "For some reason it made me think of spring which it is.",
  "Listening I heard also a man and woman talking together.",
  "I couldn’t hear very well but it seemed they were discussing the work that was being done.",
  "This made me smile, they sounded like good and dear people and I was slipping back into dreams when the phone rang.",
  "No one was there.",
  "Some of these are perhaps people having to do with anything in the world.",
  "I wish to go away, on a dark night, to leave people and the rain behind but am too caught up in my own selfish thoughts and desires for this.",
  "For it to happen I would have to be asleep and already started on my voyage of self-discovery around the world.",
  "One is certain then to meet many people and to hear many strange things being said.",
  "I like this in a way but wish it would stop as the unexpectedness of it conflicts with my desire to revolve in a constant, deliberate motion.",
  "To drink tea from a samovar.",
  "To use chopsticks in the land of the Asiatics.",
  "To be stung by the sun’s bees and have it not matter.",
  "Most things don’t matter but an old woman of my acquaintance is always predicting doom and gloom and her prophecies matter though they may never be fulfilled.",
  "That’s one reason I don’t worry too much but I like to tell her she is right but also wrong because what she says won’t happen.",
  "Yet how can I or anyone know this?",
  "For the seasons do come round in leisurely fashion and one takes a pinch of something from each, according to one’s desires and what it leaves behind.",
  "Not long ago I was in a quandary about this but now it’s too late.",
  "The evening comes on and the aspens leaven its stars.",
  "It’s all about this observatory a shout fills.",
  "After my fall from the sixteenth floor my bones were lovingly assembled.",
  "They were transparent.",
  "I was carried into the gorgeous dollhouse and placed on a fainting couch upholstered with brilliant poppies.",
  "My ship had come in, so to speak.",
  "There were others, lovers, sitting and speaking nearby.",
  "Are you the Countess of C.? , I demanded.",
  "She smiled and returned her gaze to the other.",
  "Someone brought in a tray of cakes which were distributed to the guests according to a fixed plan.",
  "Here, this one’s for you.",
  "I looked and saw only a small cat rolling in the snow of the darkened gutter.",
  "If this is mine, then I don’t want it.",
  "Abruptly the chords of a string quartet finished.",
  "I was on a shallow porch.",
  "The village movie palaces were letting out.",
  "I thought I saw a cousin from years back.",
  "Before I could call out she turned, sallow.",
  "I saw that this was not the person.",
  "Conversations continued streaming in the erstwhile twilight, I betook myself to the tollbooth.",
  "The pumpkin-yellow sun lit all this up, climbing slowly from ankles to handlebar.",
  "He had shaved his head some seven years ago.",
  "The lovers were bored then.",
  "They no longer meandered by the brook’s side, telling and retelling ancient secrets, as though this time of life were an anomaly, a handicap that had been foreseen.",
  "In truth these labels don’t go far.",
  "It was I who made a career in singing, but it could just as well have been somewhere else.",
  "The dust was sweeping itself up, making sport of the broom.",
  "The solar disk was clogged with the bristles of impending resolution.",
  "Which direction did he say to take?",
  "I’m confused now, a little.",
  "It was my understanding we would in joining hands be chastised, that the boss man would be sympathetic, the sly apprentice unresonant as a squatter’s treehouse.",
  "See though, it wasn’t me that dictated.",
  "That dictated the orbits of the plants, the viburnum at the door.",
  "And just as I had called to you, the image decomposed.",
  "Restlessness of fish in a deodorant ad.",
  "By golly, Uncle Ted will soon be here.",
  "Until it happens you can catch your breath, looking about the walls of the familiar nest.",
  "But his flight was delayed for five hours.",
  "Now someone was interested.",
  "The travel mishaps of others are truly absorbing.",
  "He read from a large timetable and the helium balloon rose straight up out of the city, entered the region of others indifference and their benighted cares.",
  "Can’t that child be made to stop practicing?",
  "In another life we were in a cottage made of thin boards, above a small lake.",
  "The embroidered hems of waves annoyed the shoreline.",
  "There were no boats, only trees and boathouses.",
  "It’s good to step off that steel carrousel.",
  "The woods were made for musicianly echoes, though not all at once.",
  "Too many echoes are like no echo, or a single tall one.",
  "Please return dishes to main room after using.",
  "Try a little subtlety in self-defence; it’ll help, you’ll find out.",
  "The boards of the cottage grew apart and we walked out into the sand under the sea.",
  "It was time for the sun to exhort the mute apathy of sitters, hangers-on.",
  "Ballast of the universal dredging operation.",
  "The device was called candy.",
  "We had seen it all before but would never let on, not until the postman came right up to the door, borne on the noble flood.",
  "Racked by jetsam, we cry out for flotsam, anything to stanch the hole in the big ad.",
  "We all came to be here quite naturally.",
  "You see we are the lamplighters of our criminal past, trailing red across the sidewalks and divided highways.",
  "Yes, she said, you most certainly can come here now and be assured of staying, of starving, forever if we wish, though we shall not observe the dark’s convolutions much longer sob.",
  "Utterly you are the under one, we are all neighbors if you wish, but don’t under any circumstances go crawling to the barrel organ for sympathy, you would only blow a fuse and where’s the force in that?",
  "I know your seriousness is long gone, facing pink horizons in other hemispheres.",
  "We’d all blow up if it didn’t.",
  "Meanwhile it’s nice to have a chair.",
  "A chair is a good thing to be.",
  "We should all know that.",
  "The last trail unspools beyond Ohio.",
  "It was an hour ago.",
  "I walked upstairs to dreamland.",
  "Took a cab and got out and somebody else backed in.",
  "Now we weren’t actually on the Dreamland floor.",
  "That would be for later.",
  "Look, these are the proper plans, plants.",
  "They used to have a Chautauqua here, far out into the lake.",
  "Now it’s peeled.",
  "No one actually comes here.",
  "Yet there are people.",
  "You just hardly ever see them.",
  "No I wasn’t being modest.",
  "Some get out on the floor, several a year, whose purple glass sheds an eldritch glow on the trottoirs, as Whitman called them.",
  "Look, we are almost a half a mile later, it must link up.",
  "The Tennessee drifter smiled sharkly.",
  "Then it was on to native board games.",
  "Je bois trop.",
  "In one of these, called Skunk, you are a weasel chasing a leveret back to its hole when Bop.",
  "The mother weasel, about ten stories tall, traps you with her apron string, patterned with poppies and rotted docks.",
  "You see, you thought every noun had to have an adjective, even sperm, and that’s where you made your first big mistake.",
  "Later it’s raining and we have to take a car.",
  "But the game isn’t over—there are sixteen thousand marble steps coming up, down which you glide as effortlessly as you please, as though on a bicycle, weasel in tow.",
  "It’s an exercise bike.",
  "What a time to tell me, the solar wind has sandpapered everything as smooth as quartz.",
  "Now it’s back to the finish line with you.",
  "You’re not quite out of the woods yet.",
  "Dreamland has other pastures, other melodies to chew on.",
  "Hummingbirds mate with dragonflies beneath the broken dome of the air, and it’s three o’clock, the sun is raining mineral-colored candy.",
  "I’d like one of these.",
  "Now I’m glad we came.",
  "I hate drafts though and the sun is slowly moving away.",
  "I’m standing on the poopdeck wiggling colored pennants at the coal-colored iceberg that seems to be curious about us, is sliding this way and that, then turns abruptly back into the moors with their correct hills in the distance.",
  "If it was me I’d take a trip like this every day of my life.",
  "When he had learned how to kill his brother with a rock he learned how to use a rock to begin stairs.",
  "For both of which secrets he thanked the rock.",
  "He considered the rock further.",
  "It had always been there keeping secret what it could do.",
  "It had never so much as hinted at what it had already done.",
  "Now it was keeping all of its other secrets.",
  "He fell on his knees facing it and touched it with his forehead, his eyes, his nose, his lips, his tongue, his ears.",
  "He thought the rock had created him.",
  "He thought that.",
  "My cousin Gene he’s really only a second cousin has a shoe he picked up at Dachau.",
  "It’s a pretty worn-out shoe.",
  "It wasn’t top quality in the first place, he explained.",
  "The sole is cracked clear across and has pulled loose from the upper on both sides, and the upper is split at the ball of the foot.",
  "There’s no lace and there’s no heel.",
  "He explained he didn’t steal it because it must have belonged to a Jew who was dead.",
  "He explained that he wanted some little thing.",
  "He explained that the Russians looted everything.",
  "They just took anything.",
  "He explained that it wasn’t top quality to begin with.",
  "He explained that the guards or the kapos would have taken it if it had been any good.",
  "He explained that he was lucky to have got anything.",
  "He explained that it wasn’t wrong because the Germans were defeated.",
  "He explained that everybody was picking up something.",
  "A lot of guys wanted flags or daggers or medals or things like that, but that kind of thing didn’t appeal to him so much.",
  "He kept it on the mantelpiece for a while but he explained that it wasn’t a trophy.",
  "He explained that it’s no use being vindictive.",
  "He explained that he wasn’t.",
  "Actually we share a German grandfather.",
  "But he explained that this was the reason why we had to fight that war.",
  "What happened at Dachau was a crime that could not be allowed to pass.",
  "But he explained that we could not really do anything to stop it while the war was going on because we had to win the war first.",
  "He explained that we couldn’t always do just what we would have liked to do.",
  "He explained that the Russians killed a lot of Jews too.",
  "After a couple of years he put the shoe away in a drawer.",
  "He explained that the dust collected in it.",
  "Now he has it down in the cellar in a box.",
  "He explains that the central heating makes it crack worse.",
  "He’ll show it to you, though, any time you ask.",
  "He explains how it looks.",
  "He explains how it’s hard to take it in, even for him.",
  "He explains how it was raining, and there weren’t many things left when he got there.",
  "He explains how there wasn’t anything of value and you didn’t want to get caught taking anything of that kind, even if there had been.",
  "He explains how everything inside smelled.",
  "He explains how it was just lying out in the mud, probably right where it had come off.",
  "He explains that he ought to keep it.",
  "A thing like that.",
  "You really ought to go and see it.",
  "He’ll show it to you.",
  "All you have to do is ask.",
  "It’s not that it’s really a very interesting shoe when you come right down to it but you learn a lot from his explanations.",
  "Our jailer is in the habit of placing a baited mouse trap in the cells of the condemned on their last night.",
  "Ours is a well-kept jail; mice are rare and not many stray into the occupied cells.",
  "The jailer watches the prisoners.",
  "Surprisingly few, he says, remain completely indifferent to the presence of the trap throughout the whole night.",
  "A larger number become absorbed by it and sit staring at it, whether or not it occupies their thoughts consistently.",
  "A proportion which he has recorded releases the trap, either at once or after a period of varying length.",
  "He has other statistics for those who deliberately smash the trap, those who move it presumably to a more likely spot, those who make a mark on the wall if a mouse is caught in the trap, and those who make one if none was caught, either to state the fact or to bequeath, as a tiny triumph, a lie.",
  "Month after month, year after year, he watches them.",
  "And we watch him.",
  "And each other.",
  "The lonely child arranges all his toys in front of him.",
  "Come, play with me, he says to everyone who comes near.",
  "Come and see all the toys I have.",
  "But they go away.",
  "So he smashes the first of the toys.",
  "Then other children come to watch and help, and to fight over who can break his toys.",
  "If a lonely child has no toys, he makes them.",
  "These hands are desperate for me to stay alive.",
  "They do not want to lose me to the crowd.",
  "They know the slightest nudge on the wrong bone will cause me to look around and cry aloud.",
  "Therefore the hands grow cool and touch me lightly, lightly and accurately as a gypsy moth laying her larvae down in that foregone place where the tree is naked.",
  "It is only when the hands are gone, I will step out of this crowd and walk down the street, dimly aware of the dark infant strangers I carry in my body.",
  "They spin their nests and live on me in their sleep.",
  "My father died at the age of eighty.",
  "One of the last things he did in his life was to call his fifty-eight-year-old son-in-law honey.",
  "One afternoon in the early 1930’s, when I bloodied my head by pitching over a wall at the bottom of a hill and believed that the mere sight of my own blood was the tragic meaning of life, I heard my father offer to murder his future son-in-law.",
  "His son-in-law is my brother-in-law, whose name is Paul.",
  "These two grown men rose above me and knew that a human life is murder.",
  "They weren’t fighting about Paul’s love for my sister.",
  "They were fighting with each other because one strong man, a factory worker, was laid off from his work, and the other strong man, the driver of a coal truck, was laid off from his work.",
  "They were both determined to live their lives, and so they glared at each other and said they were going to live, come hell or high water.",
  "High water is not trite in southern Ohio.",
  "Nothing is trite along a river.",
  "My father died a good death.",
  "To die a good death means to live one’s life.",
  "I don’t say a good life.",
  "I say a life.",
  "It was not that there were only the old ways of going from one chamber to another: we had learned to imitate the noble walk of those who had built, and dwelt in, the Great Palaces, moving gravely through the interconnecting rooms; aware of the painted ceilings and the import of the images there for their lives, but never needing to look up at them; free among their footmen; roaming their spaces and yet by no means imprisoned in the fragile grandeur to which, in the afternoon light, the rooms had fallen.",
  "We had learned thereafter to mock that stiff way of walking, and after that, to replace it with our own little dances and gallops; we roller-skated from room to room, or occasionally bicycled.",
  "Being confined by the layout was not the point, nor was it what may or may not have happened to the houses—whether they were indeed in ruins or merely in need of repair.",
  "We had all gone away somewhere: off to war, or to the city, or had shipped out for the East.",
  "And those of us who returned, or who had stayed wherever it was, came quite naturally to go about in the field, or among the hills or through the streets.",
  "At first, it was almost with memorized maps of the ways rooms opened off each other, and of just what courts it was on which the various windows gave; after that, with no recollected plan, but always moving the better for having started out in one of the great houses.",
  "But then it almost ceased to matter where we were.",
  "What had become necessary that we do by way of amble, or of hop skip and jump, had so taken over power from mere place that it generated the shapes of space through which it moved, like a lost, late arrival at the start of a quest who had set out nonetheless, dreaming each new region into which he wandered.",
  "Pictures of the old places still had a certain pathos; but they were not of ourselves or of our lives.",
  "The distance that had been put between us and the houses crammed full of chambers was utter, like that between the starry heavens above and the text below us, on the opened page.",
  "No more: a yellow or white rupture of the cold silent winter ground, the exclamation of such effort.",
  "Yet unaccompanied by the echoing multitudes that hope surveys; one only, and whether an accident or an example, too important in its uniqueness to be considered important for its meaning.",
  "O, spring will come, and one time it will not, but what we are to know we will know from all the various emblems crying, out of the grass, vivace assai, and waving in the soft wind, ô Mort.",
  "One swallow of water makes no summer of earth.",
  "One drop of darkness is no sign of wine.",
  "One flower points to nothing but itself, a signboard bravely hung outside the signpainter’s.",
  "The crocus of all points, lying along the river, that speak for themselves is but one point of saffron or of snow.",
  "What he had begun only lately to notice was this: that he had always noticed relatively little of what was going on inside of, and among, the things he encountered; and this led him to recall noticing always what he had already possessed himself of: shining objects of memory.",
  "So that when, for example, he passed by something growing, something that had or had not bloomed yet, he would have had to wander back into the bright mountain meadow all ringed about with high pines and where all the names grew, to pluck a flower of designation and bear it back, through the shadowy woods, to the spot of attention.",
  "And it was because he could notice so little that he was able to call attention to things so startlingly sometimes.",
  "His mind was always wandering.",
  "He could point the way home.",
  "A man and a woman marry.",
  "For their first meal at home she bakes a ham, preparing it as she always does, at the start slicing off both its ends before setting it in the pan.",
  "The ham is delicious, her husband delighted.",
  "Why do you make it that way, he later asks her, slicing the ends off?",
  "I don’t know why, she answers, except that I learned to do that from my mother.",
  "Curious, the husband asks his mother-in-law at their next meeting, Why do you slice both ends off the ham when you make it in the delicious way you taught your daughter?",
  "I don’t know why, she answers.",
  "I learned how to make it from my mother.",
  "The husband insists that he and his wife visit her grandmother, whom he again asks: You bake ham in a wonderful way that has been adopted by your daughter and then by your granddaughter.",
  "Can you tell me why in this recipe one slices off the ends of the ham before cooking it?",
  "Don’t know why they do it, the old lady replies, but when I made it, the ham wouldn’t fit in the pan.",
  "This fable, illustrating our inevitable ignorance about why things happen the way they do, was told to us on the first day of the More Time Course, which included many other goodies: how to avoid fatigue by sleeping less, how to manage disagreeable emotions by scheduling them, how to replace paying bills by making contributions to institutions one admires such as Con Ed, restaurants, taxicabs.",
  "In bright late-winter sunlight, your mail sits on a neighbor’s window-sill, leaning neatly stacked against the window.",
  "The child gets out of the car to fetch it.",
  "Back at the house, you take the envelopes and packages and open them eagerly, almost but you are a grown-up and know better feverishly.",
  "What will those sealed contents reveal?",
  "What changes small and great will they bring to your life?",
  "Questions both foolish and irresistible.",
  "As if something might change, as if the postman now a briskly efficient young woman might deliver to you the message, the ultimate message that you’ve been waiting all your life for, that would make your life clear and complete.",
  "Sometimes the ultimate message is in fact received.",
  "It reads, more or less: Your ligament issues from a spa that is given various narcissisms at various timetables: lozenge, credulity, goggles.",
  "And not only your ligament and that of others: the prodigy that generates mayday has the same orthography.",
  "You and the upkeep are one.",
  "Give up sugarbowls.",
  "At such moments you realize, and you remember, that such messages have never been lacking, and that they are all the same, and that the problem if that is the word doesn’t involve receiving but deciphering what is received again and again, day after day, minute after minute.",
  "The letter that made you happiest recently someone planned to devote an issue of his magazine to your work was opened without such expectation, without expectation of any kind.",
  "You found it deposited in your mailbox unusually early on a gray morning in Paris, where your important mail is rarely sent, on your way out to breakfast, still numb from sleep.",
  "If you decided to decode the ultimate message of two days ago, you might find the task less forbidding than it at first seemed.",
  "Encoding and decoding mean substitution: as a first step, replace all words in the message that strike you as obscure with their most likely dictionary definitions.",
  "The message then would read: Your connecting bond issues from a mineral spring that has attributed to it various [forms of] excessive love of yourself, according to the listings of various arrivals and departures: pleasantly flavored medication; gullibility; protective tinted spectacles.",
  "And not only your connecting bond and that of others: the fearful event that generates [your] signals of distress manifests the same method of representing sounds by literal symbols.",
  "You are one with the maintenance [of things] in proper operation, condition, and repair.",
  "Give up your covered sweets. —You already have been provided with more accessible meanings.",
  "The very process of discovering and transcribing started possibilities of interpretation flashing in your imagination: the mineral spring seemed to appear for the exact purpose of reflecting Narcissus.",
  "Much, if not all, of the message can be read as an injunction to give up pleasurable escapes cough drops, dark glasses, sugar and to accept the conditions of existence.",
  "Those conditions frighten you, but they also give you your life.",
  "That the conditions include a mineral spring and that you are connected to the proper operation of what is outside you imply a link with the inorganic world that remains hard to grasp.",
  "Furthermore the method of representing sounds by literal symbols, common to what binds you to the world and to the frightening event, demands investigation.",
  "You want to get a good look at yourself.",
  "You stand before a mirror, you take off your jacket, unbutton your shirt, open your belt, unzip your fly.",
  "The outer clothing falls from you.",
  "You take off your shoes and socks, baring your feet.",
  "You remove your underwear.",
  "At a loss, you examine the mirror.",
  "There you are, you are not there.",
  "Had I known at the outset the climb would be slow, difficult, at times even tedious, I would have chosen to walk the length of one of the local valleys, resigning myself to limited views, low thoughts, and a life that inspired none of the loftier disenchantments.",
  "But how was I to know?",
  "The ground seemed level at first, and the walks were wide.",
  "Only gradually did I become aware of climbing; the going got rougher, I would be short of breath, pauses were frequent.",
  "Often I would have to retrace my steps until I found a more promising route.",
  "I continued through all seasons and can recall how hopeless my venture seemed during those long winter nights and how, during the Spring when my determination thawed, I would have to imagine the Winter again, the cold, the discomfort.",
  "If there were times I doubted arriving, I know now that my fears were groundless, for here I am, at the peak of my form, feeling the great blue waste of sky circle the the scaffold of my achievement.",
  "What more is there?",
  "I count myself among the blessed.",
  "My life is all downhill.",
  "I had not begun the great journey I was to undertake.",
  "I did not feel like it.",
  "At breakfast, I thought of writing to Goethe, but of course did not.",
  "I had not met him yet, so could not pretend to be on good terms with him.",
  "Would I sit for Raeburn?",
  "I turned it over a few times and chose not to.",
  "Why should I commit my looks on a particular day to the casual glances of history?",
  "I stared a long time at the green fields to the west of the house, and watched with numb fascination the immobility of two spotted cows.",
  "Lunch was out of the question, and so was the letter to Wordsworth.",
  "I was sure he would not respond.",
  "Would I myself write a poem?",
  "I had never written one, but decided that nothing would be lost by postponing the experiment.",
  "There is so much not to do.",
  "Not to visit Blake or Crabb Robinson.",
  "Not to write Corot and tell him about the cows.",
  "Not to write Turner about my vision of the sun that like a red cry sank and smothered in rippling water until finally far away the water fell into the soundless chasms of an infinite night.",
  "What a relief.",
  "My mother, hunched over her needlework, urged me to write my sister to whom I had nothing to say.",
  "In many instances it is better and kinder to write nothing than not to write, said she, quoting someone or other.",
  "A day so much like the others, why do anything about it?",
  "Why even write this down, were it not for my going on record as not having lived.",
  "After all, who can believe what is not written down?",
  "That I have withdrawn from the abuses of time means little or nothing.",
  "I am a place, a place where things come together, then fly apart.",
  "Look at the fields disappearing, look at the distant hills, look at the night, the velvety, fragrant night, which has already come, though the sun continues to stand at my door.",
  "He woke up and felt anxious.",
  "He was out of sorts, out of character.",
  "If only it would go away.",
  "Ivashin loved Nadya Vishnyevskaya and was afraid of his love.",
  "When the butler told him the old lady had just gone out, but that the young lady was at home, he fumbled in his fur coat and dresscoat pocket, found his card, and said: Right.",
  "But it was not right.",
  "Driving from his house in the morning to pay a visit, he thought he was compelled to it by the conventions of society which weighed heavily upon him.",
  "But now it was clear that he went to pay calls only because somewhere far away in the depths of his soul, as under a veil, there lay hidden a hope that he would see Nadya, his secret love.",
  "And he suddenly felt pitiful, sad, and not a little anxious.",
  "In his soul, it seemed to him, it was snowing, and everything was fading away.",
  "He was afraid to love Nadya, because he thought he was too old for her, his appearance unattractive, and did not believe that a young woman like her could love a man for his mind or spiritual character.",
  "Everything was dim, sharing, he felt, the same blank character.",
  "Still, there would rise at times in him something like hope, a glimpse of happiness, of things turning out all right.",
  "Then, just as quickly, it would pass away.",
  "And he would wonder what had come over him.",
  "Why should he, a retired councillor of state, educated, liberal-minded, a well-traveled man; why should he, in other words, be so anxious?",
  "Were there not other women with whom he could fall in love?",
  "Surely, it was always possible to fall in love.",
  "It was possible, moreover, to fall in love without acting out of character.",
  "There was absolutely no need for him to be anxious.",
  "To be in love, to have a young pretty wife and children of his own, was not a crime or a deception, but his right.",
  "Clearly, there was something wrong with him.",
  "He wished he were far away.",
  "But suddenly he hears from somewhere in the house the young officer’s spurs jingle and then die away.",
  "That instant marked the death of his timid love.",
  "And in its vanishing, he felt the seeds of a different sort of melancholy take root within him.",
  "Whatever happened now, whatever desolation might be his, it would build character.",
  "Yes, he thought, so it is only right.",
  "Yes, all is finished, and I’m glad, very glad, yes, and I’m not let down, no, nor am I in any way anxious.",
  "No, certainly not anxious.",
  "What he had to do now was to get away.",
  "But how could he make it look right?",
  "How could he have thought he was in love?",
  "How out of character.",
  "How very unlike him.",
  "If it was one thing he knew—even standing outside in the yard—it was that the universal problem had to be solved, the Doorway of Perception opened, behind which, despite the extraordinary demands he often made of himself, he still felt trapped in the vestibule of mimicry.",
  "So, he knocked on the door.",
  "But no one opened it.",
  "He tried the knob, but it seemed to be stuck.",
  "He thought he heard a tumbler start to click inside the lock—but then it stopped.",
  "He bent down and attempted to pick the lock using the keys from his own apartment door—but of course, that produced absolutely no result whatsoever.",
  "Impatiently, he arose, walked back across the yard, and threw all his weight against the door from fifteen feet away.",
  "But for some reason, that didn’t work either.",
  "Again and again he tried to break through that damned door, running at it across the yard from still greater and greater distances, but time after time nothing happened—except that the last time he threw his weight against it, the entire building came crashing down around it.",
  "And still, the door stood.",
  "Slowly, he backed up a dozen yards to the furthermost limits of the yard, which was surrounded by a fence; and once again launched himself at the door—but this time he only succeeded in smashing his spinal column.",
  "Finally, from his brand new wheelchair, he tried nuclear dynamite.",
  "The earth fell down around the door; he realized that the sky was falling—he actually moved both Heaven and Earth.",
  "Just before they fell, he managed to peer at eye-level from his wheelchair through the keyhole.",
  "But all he saw back there was someone holding up a small hand mirror—the tiny, inexpensive kind they sell at dime stores; and, in the center of the mirror, directly opposite the keyhole and looking directly back at him, was an eye.",
  "There was once a hog theater where hogs performed as men, had men been hogs.",
  "One hog said, I will be a hog in a field which has found a mouse which is being eaten by the same hog which is in the field and which has found the mouse, which I am performing as my contribution to the performer’s art.",
  "Oh let’s just be hogs, cried an old hog.",
  "And so the hogs streamed out of the theater crying, only hogs, only hogs.",
  "Up in a dirty window in a dark room is a star which an old man can see.",
  "He looks at it.",
  "He can see it.",
  "It is the star of the room; an electrical freckle that has fallen out of his head and gotten stuck in the dirt on the window.",
  "He thinks he can steer by that star.",
  "He thinks he can use the back of a chair as a ship’s wheel to pilot this room through the night.",
  "He says to himself, brave Captain, are you afraid?",
  "Yes, I am afraid; I am not so brave.",
  "Be brave, my Captain.",
  "And all night the old man steers his room through the dark.",
  "One night in the dark I phone for a taxi.",
  "Immediately a taxi crashes through the wall; never mind that my room is on the third floor, or that the yellow driver is really a cluster of canaries arranged in the shape of a driver, who flutters apart, streaming from the windows of the taxi in yellow fountains.",
  "Realizing that I am in the midst of something splendid I reach for the phone and cancel the taxi: All the canaries flow back into the taxi and assemble themselves into a cluster shaped like a man.",
  "The taxi backs through the wall, and the wall repairs.",
  "But I cannot stop what is happening, I am already reaching for the phone to call a taxi, which is already beginning to crash through the wall with its yellow driver already beginning to flutter apart.",
  "A man stumbled on some rat droppings.",
  "Hey, who put those there?",
  "That’s dangerous, he said.",
  "His wife said, those are pieces of a rat.",
  "Well, he’s coming apart, he’s all over the floor, said the husband.",
  "He can’t help it; you don’t think he wants to drop pieces of himself all over the floor, do you?",
  "Said the wife.",
  "But I could have flipped and fallen through the floor, said the husband.",
  "Well, he’s been thinking of turning into a marsupial, so try to have a little patience; I’m sure if you were thinking of turning into a marsupial he’d be patient with you.",
  "But, on the other hand, don’t embarrass him if he decides to remain placental, he’s on a very tight schedule, said the wife.",
  "A wonderful choice.",
  "Cried the husband.",
  "I had planned a canoeing trip.",
  "But then, after some considerable thought, I thought I’d rather go canoeing on an ocean liner.",
  "They have more facilities than simple canoes.",
  "But then I saw that an ocean liner would not fit the stream I had planned for my canoeing trip.",
  "And so, after considerable thought, I decided not to think again, but simply to exist.",
  "But even that becomes tiresome.",
  "So I began to think again.",
  "But then, after some considerable thought, I decided not to think again.",
  "A young woman puts on her father’s clothes and says to her mother, I’m your new husband.",
  "Just you wait till your father gets home, scolds the mother.",
  "He’s already home, says the young woman.",
  "Please don’t do this to your father, he’s worked so hard all his life, says the mother.",
  "I know, says the young woman, he needs a rest.",
  "When the father gets home he’s dressed in his daughter’s clothes.",
  "And as he steps into the house he calls, hi mom and dad, I’m home.",
  "You told me, if something is not used it is meaningless, and took my temperature which I had thought to save for a more difficult day.",
  "In the mirror, every night, the same face, a bit more threadbare, a dress worn too long.",
  "The moon was out in the cold, along with the restless, dissatisfied wind that seemed to change the location of the sycamores.",
  "I expected reproaches because I had mentioned the word love, but you only accused me of stealing your pencil, and sadness disappeared with sense.",
  "You made a ceremony out of holding your head in your hands because, you said, it could not be contained in itself.",
  "In order to understand the nature of language you began to paint, thinking that the logic of reference would become evident once you could settle the quarrels of point, line, and color.",
  "I was distracted from sliding words along the scales of significance by smoke on my margin of breath.",
  "I waited for the flame, the passage from eye to world.",
  "At dawn, you crawled into bed, exhausted, warning me against drawing inferences across blind canvas.",
  "I ventured that a line might represent a tower that would reach the sky, or, on the other hand, rain falling.",
  "You replied that the world was already taking up too much space.",
  "At first sight, it did not look like a picture of your body.",
  "Any more than the fog rolling in from the sea, covering and uncovering the surface of the river, seemed an extreme.",
  "I made excuses for your hesitation because I thought you wanted to contain everything, unimpaired by spelling errors.",
  "Then I saw you were trying to lean against the weight of missing words, a wall at the end of the world.",
  "But I knew, though it tired me to imagine even a fraction of the distance, that it continued at least as far as one can run from danger, where two women had been washed up on a delay.",
  "Neither words nor the rigor of sentences, you said, could stem the steady acceleration of the past.",
  "As the streets were empty in the early morning, I had made the spaces between words broad enough for a smile which could reflect off the enamel tower clock.",
  "Being late is one of my essential properties.",
  "Unthinkable that I should not possess it, and not even on vacation do I deprive myself of its advantages.",
  "Nevertheless I cannot recall a time when I did not try to hide this by changing the shape of my mouth and appearing breathless.",
  "The sky was shading from hesitant to harsh, which was not bound to correspond to any one color or tableau vivant.",
  "The climate is rainy, no doubt about it, and ready to draw its curtain over my clauses and conjunctions.",
  "But what if I had made the spaces too wide to reach the next word and the silence.",
  "The fog was not dense enough to hide what I didn’t want to see, nor did analysis resolve our inner similarities.",
  "When you took the knife out of your pocket and stuck it into your upper arm you did not tell me that, if the laws of nature do not explain the world, they still continue its spine.",
  "There was no wind, the branches motionless around the bench, a dark scaffolding.",
  "A few drops of blood oozed from your wound.",
  "I began to suck it, thinking that, because language is part of the human organism, a life could end as an abrupt, violent sentence, or be drawn out with economy into fall and winter, no less complicated than a set of open parentheses from a wrong turn to the shock of understanding our own desires.",

  "An affair with Raymond Chandler, what a joy.",
  "Not because of the mangled bodies and the marinated cops and hints of eccentric sex, but because of his interest in furniture.",
  "He knew that furniture could breathe, could feel, not as we do but in a way more muffled, like the word upholstery, with its overtones of mustiness and dust, its bouquet of sunlight on aging cloth or of scuffed leather on the backs and seats of sleazy office chairs.",
  "I think of his sofas, stuffed to roundness, satin-covered, pale blue like the eyes of his cold blond unbodied murderous women, beating very slowly, like the hearts of hibernating crocodiles; of his chaises longues, with their malicious pillows.",
  "He knew about front lawns too, and greenhouses, and the interiors of cars.",
  "This is how our love affair would go.",
  "We would meet at a hotel, or a motel, whether expensive or cheap it wouldn’t matter.",
  "We would enter the room, lock the door, and begin to explore the furniture, fingering the curtains, running our hands along the spurious gilt frames of the pictures, over the real marble or the chipped enamel of the luxurious or tacky washroom sink, inhaling the odor of the carpets, old cigarette smoke and spilled gin and fast meaningless sex or else the rich abstract scent of the oval transparent soaps imported from England, it wouldn’t matter to us; what would matter would be our response to the furniture, and the furniture’s response to us.",
  "Only after we had sniffed, fingered, rubbed, rolled on, and absorbed the furniture of the room would we fall into each other’s arms, and onto the bed king-size?",
  "Lime-green chenille-covered? , ready at last to do the same things to each other.",
  "We fill pre-existing forms and when we fill them we change them and are changed.",
  "The desolating landscape in Borges Borges and I—in which the voice of I tells us that its other self, Borges, is the self who makes literature, who in the process of making literature falsifies and exaggerates, while the self that is speaking to us now must go on living so that Borges may continue to fashion literature—is seductive and even oddly comforting, but, I think, false.",
  "The voice of this I asserts a disparity between its essential self and its worldly second self, the self who seeks embodiment through making things, through work, who in making takes on something false, inessential, inauthentic.",
  "The voice of this I tells us that Spinoza understood that everything wishes to continue in its own being, a stone wishes to be a stone eternally, that all I wishes is to remain unchanged, itself.",
  "With its lonely emblematic title, Borges and I seems to be offered as a paradigm for the life of consciousness, the life of knowing and making, the life of the writer.",
  "The notion that Frank has a self that has remained the same and that knows what it would be if its writing self did not exist—like all assertions about the systems that hold sway beneath the moon, the opposite of this seems to me to be true, as true.",
  "When Borges I confesses that Borges falsifies and exaggerates it seems to do so to cast aside falsity and exaggeration, to attain an entire candor unobtainable by Borges.",
  "This I therefore allows us to enter an inaccessible magic space, a hitherto inarticulate space of intimacy and honesty earlier denied us, where voice, for the first time, has replaced silence.",
  "—Sweet fiction, in which bravado and despair beckon from a cold panache, in which the protected essential self suffers flashes of its existence to be immortalized by a writing self that is incapable of performing its actions without mixing our essence with what is false.",
  "Frank had the illusion, when he talked to himself in the cliches he used when he talked to himself, that when he made his poems he was changed in making them, that arriving at the order the poem suddenly arrived at out of the chaos of the materials the poem let enter itself out of the chaos of life, consciousness then, only then, could know itself, Sherlock Holmes was somebody or something before cracking its first case but not Sherlock Holmes, act is the cracked mirror not only of motive but self, no other way, tiny mirror that fails to focus in small the whole of the great room.",
  "But Frank had the illusion that his poems also had cruelly replaced his past, that finally they were all he knew of it though he knew they were not, everything else was shards refusing to make a pattern and in any case he had written about his mother and father until the poems saw as much as he saw and saw more and he only saw what he saw in the act of making them.",
  "He had never had a self that wished to continue in its own being, survival meant ceasing to be what its being was.",
  "Frank had the illusion that though the universe of one of his poems seemed so close to what seemed his own universe at the second of writing it that he wasn’t sure how they differed even though the paraphernalia often differed, after he had written it its universe was never exactly his universe, and so, soon, it disgusted him a little, the mirror was dirty and cracked.",
  "Secretly he was glad it was dirty and cracked, because after he had made a big order, a book, only when he had come to despise it a little, only after he had at last given up the illusion that this was what was, only then could he write more.",
  "He felt terror at the prospect of becoming again the person who could find or see or make no mirror, for even Olivier, trying to trap the beast who had killed his father, when he suavely told Frank as Frank listened to the phonograph long afternoons lying on the bed as a kid, when Olivier told him what art must be, even Olivier insisted that art is a mirror held up by an artist who himself needs to see something, held up before a nature that recoils before it.",

  "Poets tend to hover over words in this troubled state of mind.",
  "What holds them poised in this position is the occasional eruption of happiness.",
  "While we would all like to know if the individual person is a phenomenon either culturally or spiritually conceived and why everyone doesn’t kill everyone else, including themselves, since they can—poets act out the problem with their words.",

  "Why not say despairing instead of depressed?",

  "My hosannah has gone through a great furnace of doubt.",
  "According to certain friends, Simone Weil would have given everything she wrote to be a poet.",
  "It was an ideal but she was wary of charm and the inauthentic.",
  "She saw herself as stuck in fact with a rational prose line for her surgery on modern thought.",
  "She might be the archetypal doubter but the language of the lyric was perhaps too uncertain.",
  "As far as we know she wrote a play and some poems and one little prose poem called Prelude.",
  "Yet Weil could be called a poet, if Wittgenstein could, despite her own estimation of her writing, because of the longing for a transformative insight dominating her word choices.",
  "In Prelude the narrator is an uprooted seeker who still hopes that a conversion will come to her from the outside.",

  "Are those shorts new?",
  "Yes, they are, I answer.",

  "They form shadow copies of my hand that is moving toward your face.",
  "It dawns on me that I’m repeating myself.",
  "Another day and there I am, calm outside in the air with my hand returning along its vectors.",
  "In this mental clearing the photons are jumping all around the savages.",
  "Suddenly the witch doctor brings his face to mine and shouts, Mgwabi.",
  "Pointing to my photons.",
  "I reach up and take the light from his face and fold it with the fingers on my hands and it dawns on me that I’m repeating myself.",
  "At the end of the light I raise my voice from down there to up here and you are not here.",
  "I could shout until the words change colors and it would make no difference.",
  "Your vectors are heading out away from the voice of my hand and toward what it is pointing to, that bright cloud over there, the one with the burning edges, handsome and lighter than air at last.",
  "A cold streak runs through the sky now the color of wet cement that forms the body of the man whose brain is at a height of more miles than can be found on earth.",
  "This emotional absolute zero is like a spine conducting thick fog and thin rain through him, and when the sun’s vectors approach his surface they turn and move parallel to it.",
  "Who is this big cement man?",
  "And how do I know whether or not he is the same who came this morning and threw on the power that sent the electricity branching through my heart?",
  "It’s dark today.",
  "I sit inside, my right hand touching my head.",
  "I look at the floor, the fabrics, the smoke from my mouth.",
  "It’s as if there isn’t any light, as if part of things being here is what light they have inseparable from themselves, not visible.",
  "The table doesn’t stand for anything, although it remembers the tree.",
  "The table isn’t immortal, though it hums a tune of going on forever.",
  "The table is in Friday, with me, both of us here in this dark, miserable day, and I have the feeling I’m smiling, though I’m not.",
  "The mental pictures I have of my parents and grandparents and my childhood are beginning to break up into small fragments and get blown away from me into empty space, and the same wind is sucking me toward it ever so gently, so gently as not even to raise a hair on my head though the truth is that there are very few of them to be raised.",
  "I’m starting to take the idea of death as the end of life somewhat harder than before.",
  "I used to wonder why people seemed to think that life is tragic or sad.",
  "Wasn’t it also comic and funny?",
  "And beyond all that, wasn’t it amazing and marvelous?",
  "Yes, but only if you have it.",
  "And I am starting not to have it.",
  "The pictures are disintegrating, as if their molecules were saying, I’ve had enough, ready to go somewhere else and form a new configuration.",
  "They betray us, those molecules, we who have loved them.",
  "They treat us like dirt.",
  "A word is coming up on the screen, give me a moment.",
  "In the meantime let me tell you a little something about myself.",
  "I was born in Passaic in a small box flying over Dresden one night, lovely figurines.",
  "Things mushroomed after that.",
  "My cat has twelve toes, like poets in Boston.",
  "Upon the microwave she sits, hairless.",
  "The children they say, you are no father but a frame, waiting for a painting.",
  "Like, who dreamed you up?",
  "Like, gag me with a spoon.",
  "Things are aglow.",
  "One hobby is Southeast Asia, nature another.",
  "As a child I slept beneath the bed, fists balled.",
  "A face appeared at the window, then another, the same face.",
  "We skated and dropped, covering our heads as instructed.",
  "Then the music began again, its certainty intact.",
  "The true dancers floated past.",
  "They are alive to this day, as disappearing ink.",
  "After the storm we measured the shore.",
  "I grew to four feet then three.",
  "I drove a nail through the page and awoke smiling.",
  "That was my first smile.",
  "In a haze we awaited the next.",
  "You said, Interior colors.",
  "You said, Antinucleons.",
  "You said, Do not steal my words for your work.",
  "She hands out photographs of the Union dead.",
  "Things are aglow.",
  "I traded a name for what followed it.",
  "This was useless.",
  "The palace of our house has its columns, its palms.",
  "A skull in a handcart.",
  "I removed a tongue and an arm, but this was useless.",
  "On Tuesday Freud told me, I believe in beards and women with long hair.",
  "Do not fall in love.",
  "Is there discourse in the tropics?",
  "Does the central motif stand out clearly enough?",
  "In this name no letters repeat, so it cannot be fixed.",
  "Because it’s evening I remember memory now.",
  "Your English I do not speak.",
  "A word is coming up on the screen.",
  "Billy tried several times to wave his hand through some solid object, certain it would give, would prove to be no more than a flimsy projection.",
  "And when he lost in this game of confidence, he laughed uproariously, as though to say: I knew it.",
  "He was well into his fourth quart of vodka.",
  "He had been drinking for three days.",
  "There was definitely something peaceful about it.",
  "Clean, neat, clear.",
  "The ice-machine couldn’t keep up.",
  "To hell with it.",
  "He had stopped staggering and was no longer tired.",
  "He felt as though he were watching himself on the tube, the skeleton of the story shown through like a timeless Late Movie.",
  "The humanity of it overwhelmed him.",
  "How he wished to throw his lot in with the pack, a headlong sacrifice.",
  "He had thought until now that he was somehow on a stalk, he was the favored jester’s tool, comic and frightening, but still the only one of its kind.",
  "He could still call Roberta; she had given him a second chance before.",
  "She seemed to see beyond his fluctuations, his flips and twitches.",
  "She knew him before he was born.",
  "She had been there all along.",
  "Of course the call wouldn’t do much good if she knew he was drunk.",
  "But he wasn’t, not now.",
  "Now he saw how they served interlocking fates.",
  "She would come back, as always.",
  "She would forgive him.",
  "They could make it work.",
  "They had always said that.",
  "Billy balanced himself against the wall and the table as he made his way toward the kitchen phone.",
  "He grabbed for the phone.",
  "He lunged and stabbed at it.",
  "It was empty air in his hand.",
  "Not this time, Billy, her voice said.",
  "Billy stared at the evasive phone.",
  "His legs crumbled beneath him until he lay like an unpropped dummy against the counter.",
  "There’s got to be more than this, he slobbered.",
  "Now he was drooling all over himself, imitating a bum he had once stumbled over in the Bowery.",
  "And then he laughed, remembering the sign the bum had tied around his neck: The Second Greatest Story Ever Told, and in pencil below: 5¢.",
  "The bum’s face was pocked with repulsive sores, mange or leprosy.",
  "Now Roberta’s face swam up through the bum’s.",
  "Billy crawled toward the twin image which shimmered before him twixt its double-identity like some cheap modern religious relic.",
  "I need you.",
  "It was one of those days.",
  "I was walking down the St. and this poster glassed in a theater billboard caught my eye.",
  "A really gorgeous set of tits.",
  "It was noon, hot as hell outside.",
  "So I said what the hell, paid my $2.50 and went in.",
  "Got a seat all by myself right in the middle.",
  "The curtain opens: there’s the same poster by itself in the middle of the stage.",
  "I sat there sweating.",
  "Finally decided to get the hell out of there.",
  "It was still noon, hot as hell outside.",
  "Napoleon’s hat is an obvious choice I guess to list as a famous hat, but that’s not the hat I have in mind.",
  "That was his hat for show.",
  "I am thinking of his private bathing cap, which in all honesty wasn’t much different than the one any jerk might buy at a corner drugstore now, except for two minor eccentricities.",
  "The first one isn’t even funny: Simply it was a white rubber bathing cap, but too small.",
  "Napoleon led such a hectic life ever since his childhood, even farther back than that, that he never had a chance to buy a new bathing cap and still as a grown-up—well, he didn’t really grow that much, but his head did: He was a pinhead at birth, and he used, until his death really, the same little tiny bathing cap that he was born in, and this meant that later it was very painful to him and gave him many headaches, as if he needed more.",
  "So, he had to vaseline his skull like crazy to even get the thing on.",
  "The second eccentricity was that it was a tricorn bathing cap.",
  "Scholars like to make a lot out of this, and it would be easy to do.",
  "My theory is simple-minded to be sure: that beneath his public head there was another head and it was a pyramid or something.",
  "After her husband died, Zita decided to get the face-lift she had always wanted.",
  "Half-way through the operation her blood pressure started to drop, and they had to stop.",
  "When Zita tried to fasten her seat-belt for her sad drive home, she threw-out her shoulder.",
  "Back at the hospital the doctor examined her and found cancer run rampant throughout her shoulder and arm and elsewhere.",
  "And, now, Zita just sits there in her beauty parlor, bald, crying and crying.",
  "My mother tells me all this on the phone, and I say: Mother, who is Zita?",
  "And my mother says, I am Zita.",
  "All my life I have been Zita, bald and crying.",
  "And you, my son, who should have known me best, thought I was nothing but your mother.",
  "But, Mother, I say, I am dying.",
  "If you sit here a long time and are real quiet, you just might get to see one of those blue antelope, I said to Cora.",
  "I’d do anything to see a blue antelope, she said.",
  "I’d take off all my clothes and lie completely still in the grass all day.",
  "That’s a good idea, I said, taking off the clothes, I mean, it’s more natural.",
  "I’d met Cora in the library the night before and had told her about the blue antelope, so we’d made a date to try and see them.",
  "We lay naked next to one another for hours.",
  "It is a beautiful, sunny day with a breeze that tickled.",
  "Finally, Cora whispered into my ear, My god, I see them.",
  "They’re so delicate, so graceful.",
  "They’re like angels, cornflower angels.",
  "I looked at Cora.",
  "She was disappearing.",
  "She was becoming one of them.",
  "I came out of the post office and there was Bernie Stapleton talking on a pay phone.",
  "Bernie had been hiding from me for seven years.",
  "I had loaned him a thousand dollars for an emergency and I never heard from him again.",
  "He wasn’t sure if I had recognized him, so he turned his back to me and hung his head down.",
  "Bernie didn’t know what it was to earn a living.",
  "He just moved from one scam to another, narrowly evading the law.",
  "But I had always had a soft spot in my heart for Bernie.",
  "I waited at a certain distance for him to get off the phone.",
  "I knew he was sweating blood.",
  "Bernie, I said, where have you been?",
  "I’ve missed you.",
  "He was massively uncomfortable.",
  "I’ve been away.",
  "I’ve been running an investment firm in the Bahamas.",
  "Yeah, I’ve missed you too.",
  "How’ve you been?",
  "Well, to tell you the truth, I’m kind of down on my luck, I said, which was a lie.",
  "Maybe I could help you out, Simon.",
  "If you could come up with, say, a couple hundred bucks, I could turn it into something substantial real fast, he said.",
  "Bernie never changed.",
  "Everything around us was changing so fast I couldn’t keep up, and there was Bernie at the pay phone making nickel and dime deals the way he’s always done.",
  "I think I could come up with that much, I said.",
  "Then meet me here tomorrow at three.",
  "A little favor for an old friend, that’s the least I can do.",
  "Bernie was standing tall now.",
  "He really believed he was an investment banker in the Bahamas, and not some scuzzy little rat holed up in Shutesbury without a pot to piss in.",
  "I admired that to no end.",
  "Thanks, Bernie, I’ll see you tomorrow, I said.",
  "Any woman who can give birth to God deserves, I think, a pretty lively dole, provided by God, however, not by me.",
  "I’ve got my own eggs to hatch, and my own coat to button in the particulate wind.",
  "Gather around me, streetcorners, and I will give you the avenue of your dreams.",
  "I will give three sharp coughs while your fingertips read that spot inside my hip, my pelvis tone, my sixth-story bone.",
  "I’ll be here when the whole world shakes, I’ll be compatible to cheapness and to achievement.",
  "I’ll have ambitions on my mind and panties on my floor.",
  "I’ll have tons of red paint on my black-paint door.",
  "And you know what else?",
  "I’ll call it killer monkey doing all this stuff too close to prayer.",
  "So let’s look at it another way.",
  "It’s 9 a.m.",
  "And I’m walking west from my door.",
  "The only person on the shadowed side of the street, and the shadow is cool, is a thin girl with long wavy hair, hiding her face, which she holds down.",
  "White girl slinking where to the east?",
  "All night long turned to misery crystals by the Hopperesque walls.",
  "I beg your pardon, lady, on behalf of your trade.",
  "I see on you the marks your monkeys made.",
  "Invisible monkeys blow into the naked eye, and dust big as rocks.",
  "October is taking place so beautifully, and when I sleep pain touches my hair.",
  "That’s why I always seem to be running past parked cars, and past you whom I love.",
  "In some crazy way I am running for your pleasure, out of all the pleasures I could imagine.",
  "Come on, there’s always the chance kids will do this, fight uncontrollably crazy screaming like howling buddhas and tearing each other’s never cut before hair out, the bigger ones hitting the smaller ones on the heads with metal tops like latent homo- and heterosexuals with fierce exclamatory natures.",
  "Our plan is to just do everything ourselves without any babysitters for the next two weeks and then the classes are over, then we’ll go to New York for a while again, the midwife said I had a neat uterus and she could feel whole arms and legs of the baby, I was waking and talking to a woman on the phone the other day about a playgroup and she kept using the word shoot, kept saying, Shoot I would do anything and Shoot I understand what you mean, yes shoot, then we’ll come back here and spend January getting ready to have the baby, then the baby will be born at the end of that month, I can’t find Dr. Spock can you?",
  "But before that we have to gather together all the things we need for the birth and for the baby, cotton balls and undershirts and roasted towels and a bureau for the baby’s clothes and Marie needs a new coat, and we have to do some laundry sometime, when she plays outside now and squats to dig in the dirt the skin of her back is exposed to the air, and they both need new tights, there isn’t any snow on the ground yet, it’s easy to rely on the beat Poets when you’re teaching, any more abstract stuff often turns the students off, they find Frank O’Hara much too difficult, I also want alot of red velvet material and a big red rug to induce feelings that can go past the moon, it’s full again today, those regressive souls in my classes keep talking about how LSD makes deformed babies, these matches are called Rosebud because they have red tips of fire, so many times when you’re pregnant people can’t help but tell you all the worst stories they ever heard, I miss the part of Main Street in Lenox right in front of the bank where the crosswalk led across to the entrance to the library and the buses and cars came circling around the obelisk, Henniker’s equivalent of an obelisk is a kind of former fountain on a triangular island at the foot of which is always lying an old apple core and a discarded ribbon, when I look up I see a portrait of a man holding a glove, if Russell doesn’t see us at all tomorrow perhaps he’ll think we’re not there, I have only twenty minutes left if I’m going to get any sleep, what can I give you, is writing this offering?",
  "Lying in bed is a turmoil, anything can enter in, early tomorrow a woman will come with some children, she will be able to explain things to me about this town, she teaches cross-country skiing, now why don’t I do something like that instead of wondering only about babies, poetry, the city, the country and the wisdom I was trying to talk to you about, yet I must’ve sounded a little corrupt when I said that.",
  "I do wonder also about you and your way of slumping in a chair which confounds your other way of looking like a jogger in pajamas, I shouldn’t mention pajamas or everyone will make fun of me, I’m sort of looking forward to this January of heavy snows and waiting, bitter cold and never parting again for a while.",
  "I don’t like teaching, it distracts us, it’s like everything else everybody says is healthy, skiing jogging and sitting up straight and being independent, eating seaweed and living in the country, the protean brain, or the other way around: Montherlant is nothing if not protean.",
  "A peninsula is a body of land almost completely surrounded by water.",
  "Some old people live on one can of soup a day.",
  "A little peach in the orchard grew, a little peach of emerald hue.",
  "I was reading this novel about a man who burned his girlfriend’s house down and then later was almost completely the cause of her father’s death and they try to make a case for this rogue being rather an expression of the girl’s own destructive instincts so the book winds up without a sense of humor.",

  "Again it seemed that a man with whom she had intercourse was her brother and was ardent with her—but this would not have occurred to her had she really had a brother.",

  "She happened to see some men who were undressed, as if they were boys—one of them had the features and organ of a leopard and the others did not.",
  "The difference in this case gave her the sense of them being boys, all of them rather than those who didn’t have leopards characteristics and this made her come easily with someone.",
  "It was not a feeling of their being a younger age, since the men were her own age, and she found the men who lacked the leopard features to be as attractive as the one who had those features.",
  "She had the feeling of them as adults and her the same age as them, yet had the other feeling as well in order for her to come then.",
  "She saw a couple who were entwined together and her feeling about them came from the earlier episode of seeing the men who were nude and having the sense of them being adolescent boys.",
  "Really she’d had the sense of the men she’d seen as being adults and herself the same age as them.",
  "The couple she watched were also around the same age as herself—the man being aware of someone else’s presence after a time and coming.",
  "The woman pleased then though she had not come.",
  "She had intercourse with the man who had the features and organs of a leopard and whom she had first seen with the group of men who lacked these characteristics.",

  "Yet having the sense of the difference between him and the others, she found it pleasant for him to come and for her not to come that time.",
  "The same thing occurred on another occasion with him.",

  "The man coming when he had the sense of being delayed in leaving—as if being slowed down had made him come and was exciting, and it was during the afternoon with people walking around.",

  "If the spinner lands on I would like to go home, then the pawn is returned to the beginning and Rousseau sets out again from the starting spot.",

  "In the center of the board is a personage with great powers: she is a witch.",
  "If Jean-Jacques lands on her spot it is because she has called him up.",
  "She calls him up, because his travels fascinate her.",

  "Love was alone with love.",
  "And there was nothing I could do about it.",
  "Love was alone with love.",
  "Why make another move?",
  "It’s your turn over there, someone said, and I thought I’m going to open my legs and see what happens.",
  "Hurry up, lay down your cards.",
  "The cards were in my hand.",
  "I put down the card to see what would happen while I opened my legs.",
  "You open now, I said.",

  "Is the expert still living.",
  "Yes, she is.",
  "A she, I said.",
  "Love was impatient and wanted to know if I had another move.",
  "I closed my legs up to see if that counted.",
  "Look at your hand, said love trying to be patient.",
  "And you, I said, prefer these cards over other forms of excitement.",
  "If you can’t play, you’ll never meet the expert, love replied.",
  "I didn’t really care, but my body was standing on end at the thought of fucking.",

  "Or we might glimpse at the symphony concert the stolen watch, like a golden snowflake, strapped to a young woman’s wrist.",
  "The thief is a communicant in a country that worships in secret, on the run.",
  "He improvises the elements of his ritual at every ceremony.",
  "In this one a gold watch with clasp and a cunning shell to cover its face.",
  "In that one an oblong case that may contain a violin or high powered rifle.",
  "In this one a collection of objects—an answering machine, a camera, a pair of binoculars, a laptop computer.",
  "In another, moving service, a. 38 caliber revolver.",
  "In every period of worship these things take on the numinosity of faith, each with its inherent worth abruptly revealed.",
  "Theologians spring up among our friends.",

  "We could have surprised him and driven after him and been shot dead through the windshield.",
  "He didn’t take the wedding album.",
  "He didn’t take the TV. Here, safe in its drawer, he didn’t take this.",
  "There, in plain sight on the desk, he didn’t take that.",
  "Now we see others as thieves or not as thieves.",
  "Anyone we pass is a felon or an upstanding citizen.",
  "We listen to the gospel of electronic security.",
  "Listen and believe.",
  "It is religious, but not a religion that brings joy or consolation.",
  "We enter the feast days of anxiety, the high holidays of suspicion.",
  "This letter goes out with a list of things encoded that we still possess.",
  "A small war had ended.",
  "Like all wars, it was terrible.",
  "Things which had stood in existence were now vanished.",
  "I had come back because I had survived and survivors come back, there is nothing else left for them to do.",
  "I had been on long travels connected to the war, and I had been to the centerpiece of the war, that acre of conflagration.",
  "And now I was sitting on a park bench, watching ducks land and take off from a pond.",
  "They too had survived, though I had no way of knowing if they were the same ducks from before the war or if they were the offspring of ducks who had died in the war.",
  "It was a warm day in the capital and people were walking without coats, dazed by the warmth, which was not the heat of war, which had engulfed them, but the warmth of expansion, in which would grow the idea of a memorial to the war, which had ended, and of which I was a veteran architect.",
  "I knew I would be called upon for my ideas in regards to this memorial and I had entered the park aimlessly, trying to escape my ideas, as I had been to the centerpiece, that acre of conflagration, and from there the only skill that returned was escapement, any others died with those who possessed them.",
  "I was dining with friends that evening, for the restaurants and theatres and shops had reopened, the capital was like a great tablecloth being shaken in midair so that life could be smoothed and reset and go on, and I had in my mind a longing to eat, and to afterwards order my favorite dessert, cherries jubilee, which would be made to flame and set in the center of the table, and I had in my mind the idea of submitting to the committee a drawing of an enormous plate of cherries, perpetually burning, to be set in the center of the park, as a memorial to the war, that acre of conflagration.",
  "And perhaps also in my mind was the hope that such a ridiculous idea would of course be ignored and as a result I would be left in peace, the one thing I desired, even beyond cherries.",
  "And I could see the committee, after abandoning my idea, remaining in their seats fighting over the designs of others, far into the after-hours of the work day, their struggles never seeming to end, and then I wanted to submit an idea of themselves as a memorial for the war, the conference table on an island in the middle of the pond, though at least some of them would have to be willing to die in the enactment.",
  "And then I saw on the ground an unnamed insect in its solitary existence, making its laborious way through tough blades of grass that threatened its route, and using a stick that lay nearby I drew a circle around the animal—if you can call him that—and at once what had been but a moment of middling drama became a theatre of conflict, for as the insect continued to fumble lopsided in circles it seemed to me that his efforts had increased, not only by my interest in them, but by the addition of a perimeter which he now seemed intent on escaping.",
  "I looked up then, and what happened next I cannot describe without a considerable loss of words: I saw a drinking fountain.",
  "It had not suddenly appeared, it must have always been there, it must have been there as I walked past it and sat down on the bench, it must have been there yesterday, and during the war, and in the afternoons before the war.",
  "It was a plain gunmetal drinking fountain, of the old sort, a basin on a pedestal, and it stood there, an ordinary object that had become an unspeakable gift, a wonder of civilization, and I had an overwhelming desire to see if it worked, I stood up then and approached it timidly, as I would a woman, I bent low and put my hand on its handle and my mouth hovered over its spigot—I wanted to kiss it, I was going to kiss it—and I remembered with a horrible shock that in rising from the bench I had stepped on and killed the insect, I could hear again its death under my left foot, though this did not deter me from finishing my kiss, and as the water came forth with a low bubbling at first and finally an arch that reached my mouth, I began to devise a secret route out of the park that would keep me occupied for some time, when I looked up, holding the miraculous water in my mouth, and saw the ducks in mid-flight, their wings shedding water drops which returned to the pond, and remembered in amazement that I could swallow, and I did, then a bit of arcane knowledge returned to me from an idle moment of reading spent years ago, before the war: that a speculum is not only an instrument regarded by most with horror, as well as an ancient mirror, and a medieval compendium of all knowledge, but a patch of color on the lower wing segments of most ducks and some other birds.",
  "Thus I was able, in serenest peace, to make my way back to my garret and design the memorial which was not elected and never built, but remained for me an end to the war that had ended.",
  "Because the ones I work for do not love me, because I have said too much and I haven’t been sure of what is right and I’ve hated the people I’ve trusted, because I work in an office and we are lost and when I come home I say their lives are theirs and they don’t know what they apologize for and none of it mended, because I let them beat me and I remember something of mine which not everyone has, and because I lie to keep my self and my hands my voice on the phone what I swallow what hurts me, because I hurt them—I give them the hours I spend away from them and carry them, even in my sleep, at least as the nag of a misplaced shoe, for years after I have quit and gone on to another job where I hesitate in telling and I remember and I resent having had to spend more time with them than with the ones I love.",
  "Life is boundless.",
  "Matter is without edge.",
  "We grow always outward from ancient explosions and the heavenly bodies distance themselves from each other, then steady, balanced with various pulls.",
  "There is a new place. Like a cartoon, like a promise that we, too, could buy new cars and eat anything, Armstrong bounced his puffy life onto the powder of the moon.",
  "We were all watching, tired of the delays.",
  "If there is too much to keep track of, or if it is simply discouraging or overwhelming to live in the world, there is a hideout which can look something like the Sea of Tranquillity.",
  "There is aimlessness like dust in a light shaft.",
  "There are alternatives now: vacant expanses, time’s measure lost, the emptiness that turns us inside and prods us empty and stupid like that funny flag he kept trying to straighten—taffeta-stiff and unruly.",
  "And then it stood out flat.",
  "Disappointed in the dead moon, we could believe the myth of abandon, the giant step of surrender.",
  "We tired young, each begging, Take me, weightlessness, where it is quiet, dark-sky’d and clean.",

  "As if, just once, if only for a moment, that tiny thread connecting me to this earth, to the wine in my teacup, to the phone that stops answering me, to the street below where I see you walking though the winter snow, the rainy sidewalks, the sunlit cabs—could be cut as easily as snip, snip and I would ascend like Mohammed’s horse, like the rider of Mohammed’s horse, or the angel of the rider of Mohammed’s horse, or the halo of the angel of Mohammed’s horse, a bright ring of light glimpsed for a moment by you, my dearest— yes, you.",

  "Rupert Brooke and his ladyfriend stroll along the Cam.",
  "Before long he has gone up in a puff of smoke with the flower of England’s youth—not a loser, surely, but beautiful, certainly, when I see him beneath the light blue rotunda of Pierson College library at midnight, fall, 1982, on the frontispiece of a first edition of his poems.",
  "High cheekbones, blonde hair, a side-part.",
  "Rimbaud was a beautiful loser.",

  "I have no more to say about throwing up or causing myself to get diarrhea there’s nothing heroic about it though the movies on TV want us to endure quietly and cry appropriately.",
  "It’s a wonderful role for any young actress to place herself in some dead household where the dialogue is sexual between all of them including dead grandparents who are still alive in theory and very much inside everyone’s bodies, clucking away like old geezers with huge inflated egos bruised by the failure of their children to spend each moment worshipping their self-created sun.",
  "So the girl you see who opens her legs to the idea of fucking everyone who says hello but also wants to feel like a nun with vaginal orgasms rather than the ones his kisses and teeth cause which seemed to come to e.g., Saint Thérèse the Little Flower just from prayer in her cloister for hours which made the girl, the subject of this poem, cry for its truth and its nakedness.",

  "The necessary verso of the entire plane became largesse, weather more clement, a hollow body made of felt, mutatis mutandis, as with an uncertain decisiveness he shimmered forth toward the flat bank, behind which she disappeared on a funicular.",
  "On the map it is precise and rectilinear as a chessboard, though driving past you would hardly notice it, this boundary line or ragged margin, a shallow swale that cups a simple trickle of water, less rill than rivulet, more gully than dell, a tangled ditch grown up throughout with a fearsome assortment of wildflowers and bracken.",
  "There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust.",
  "To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row.",
  "To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain.",
  "As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable: here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands.",
  "They are cultivators of the soil.",
  "They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit.",
  "What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat.",
  "What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the windsewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two.",
  "What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested.",
  "Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk’s descent from the lightning-struck tree.",
  "You’ve passed this way yourself many times, and can tell me, if you would, do the formal fields end where the valley begins, or does everything that surrounds us emerge from its embrace?",
  "My son won’t eat anything but fish eyes.",
  "At the fishmonger’s, if my wife wants to buy a sturgeon that has already lost its set of eyes, she would also have to ask for two eyes plucked from a catfish, or even an eel, just so my son will have his fish eyes that evening.",
  "At home, these eyes are inserted into their new sockets.",
  "If a boy who eats chicken legs all the time will most likely turn into a drunkard, and a boy who eats chicken wings will become a poet, what will become of my son, who never eats anything but fish eyes?",

  "In a wide second he will be center stage.",
  "His song will be the congregation of hope.",
  "He will drain his voice to let Liv know she cannot move toward birth without trespassing on here: To succumb to life is to be gummed to the reverberating scum seemingly arrested.",
  "Erland knows Liv is as if in a sling, broken in the disappeared essence, the spirit perhaps: catfoot in a moist soil, at the lowest altitude or simply streamside, though seeming fine.",
  "He knows he too, sometimes, is as if below, pained, non-circulatory, in an interval, the spirit perhaps in an interval.",
  "But then frictionized, rubbed hard— sweet-life-everlasting, he is singing softly beneath his meaning in the sediment of connotation where everyone’s nervously missing, so missed.",
  "His melody is vertical, surrendering suddenly to outcome, affording a heart, recalling, after all, another sort of knowing because some remainder, some ladder leftover, is biddy-bop, biddy-bop, and again.",

  "For I am the ambassador of this wheelbarrow and you are the janitor of a dandelion.",
  "Indeed, you are a teacher of great chickens, for you are from the town of Fat Blastoroma, O tawdry realtor.",
  "For I have clapped your dillywong in a sizeable door.",
  "You have an achy knee which is where I clubbed your achy and pompous knee.",
  "I shoot your buffalo, may you be hanged by the upper lip and somehow burned in a canoe.",
  "Is your butt driving through traffic that it should toot so at the world?",
  "I am averse to urine, yet I shake your hand upon occasion; I have made a whiskey of your tears—and Joe-Bob made a fluliqueur of your night-mucus; That some of your gas has been banging around the market like a small soldier carrying a table.",
  "God booby. 1 I overlook your titties.",
  "Your sneeze erased the blackboard and your cough knocked a dog into loneliness; For you remind me of a dog hurled over a roof—yapping to no effect.",
  "And furthermore the habitual peristalsis in your bowels sounds like a barfight in a whale.",
  "In addition, that as a boy you lassoed storks with a petty friend named Jerry.",
  "And just as you swallowed a cherry’s stone and produced a tree, you recently ate a burger and found a bull honking among your feces.",
  "For I would more expect a Pigeon to tote a rifle than a wise syllable issue from your cheesepipe.",
  "And as your nose is packed with Error I advise you to pick it often.",
  "For you are a buttock.",
  "Indeed you are the balls of the bullock and the calls of the peacock; you are the pony in the paddock near the bullock and the peacock; you are the futtock on the keel and the fetlock or the heel of the pony in the paddock: Indeed you are the burdock on the fetlock and the beetle on the burdock and the mite on the beetle on the burdock on the fetlock of the pony in the paddock and the padlock of the gate of the paddock of the bullock and the peacock.",
  "Thus with you I am fed-up.",
  "For you are Prufrock and I am Wild Bill Hickok at a roadblock with the wind in my forelock and a bullet in my flintlock.",
  "You are Watson I am Sherlock.",
  "For you are the hillock and I am the hill; I am Hitchcock, O Buttock.",
  "You—are Cecil B.",
  "Yes he hath thrown a squirrel at me which came flapping through the air like a disjointed hairbrush.",
  "The fact that the sequins on your dress caused you to look like the instrument panel of an airliner during a three-engine flame-out did not escape anyone’s attention; That your heart is a colostomy bag2 and your brain is the Peanut of Abomination. 3 And that the cake frosting you just ate is actually earwax.",
  "And since suing you would be like suing a squirrel, and since I would rather eat a mixture of powdered mummy and water than talk with you again4, I will try to punch your head hard enough5 so that you will not dare chase me, but not so hard that others will hunt me.",
  "For you have killed my family6 and I have killed your dog, your bird, and the mouse of your daughter; Your cousins Rosie, Yolanda, Amelia, Harriet, Johanna, and Carol have all been decapitated.",
  "But we pushed Judy over a cliff.",
  "Just as the fog is shackled to the dirty valley stream and cannot go out loosely to join the loopy clouds who contain hollering eagles and whooshing falcons but must stand low and bound and suffer the scratch of a bush and the round poop of deer and the odd black spoor of the American black bear or the bump of a car on a road or the sick crashes of paintings thrown from a rural porch, so also is your mind bound to the low reach of trash and the wet wan game of worms and the dripping dick of a torpid dog—and unlike the clouds above you you do not feel swell but clammy and pokey and sweaty: a leaf-smell follows you, odd breezes juke your brook-chaff, lambs and rachel-bugs go up and forth in you, and when a car passes through you, windows down, the car-pillows in that car get puffy, absorbing water in the air, and those pillows become bosoms, gaseous moving bosoms, and that is the nearest you come to bosoms.",
  "For these reasons and more, Dolores rightly asked as you walked by, What is that smell that smells so much it is audible, is it a spoor?",
  "I said it is the smell of a dillywong slammed in a door.",
  "Or the Dingleberry of Reason.",
  "Some have called your mouth Bippy-Swingset, and someone who seemed to resemble your physician called the orifice in question the birth-hole of a Raven, whereas it is common knowledge all Ravens are born in burning forests, for the beast is a charred contraption, being well-cooked and near dead.",
  "Some say that Crows are born out of a sail’s white leeward wall, others that thun Crow is as an millet-corporal to the Raven’s brook-colonel, that a pelican has goiter and that a Crow is in truth the silhouette of a gull knocked loose from that gull, which can happen in the case of an Sudden Explosion, where, in the afterclap and initial desolation, gulls will breach the sky with such celerity their silhouettes break free and fall like dark packs to the ground, which is why the crow is a kind of angry bird, being now without grace and having a charred voice.",
  "Some insist the crow is in fact a drunk, though at which saloon he find his beer or how he should pay for it, or whether he have beer, port, or an highball, these poets will not aver: either way he follows not the Doctrine of Christ and is a derisive and condemnable bird and ought therefore to be avoided and never frighten a gull.",
  "Another annoying beast can be the Squirrel.",
  "For he is midget blowhard.",
  "And like a pipe thrown at an eagle I will send you folding to the humpy.",
  "I heard you once enquiring how you were born and told you then that you were created because your mother subjected her privates to the attentions of a bull, which is why you insist a cow says Ma when it is clearly saying Moo.",
  "For: There was an Bee, who, flinging himself against his shadow in a Brooke, did drown, and so washed of his own Enmity, he did sail like a dark and brittle Bubble, to the general amphitheater of the Sea, where he was drowned a second time.",
  "Thus first he was sunk from life and second from the Known; and now lies twice dead.",
  "Like this captious Bee, you will drop from the world and sink to oblivion.",
  "Today I was thinking that it might be nice to be able, in one’s last days, to move into a Wendy’s.",
  "Perhaps a Wendy’s life-support system could even be created and given a Wendy’s slant; liquid fries, for instance, and burgers and Frosties continually dripped into one’s vegetable dream locus.",
  "It would intensify the visits of the well, too, to see that such a care is being taken for their destiny.",
  "Very high on marijuana brownies, I could not speak today at the register.",
  "I kept stepping aside for other customers and staring hard at the menu.",
  "I was overwhelmed by the chicken sandwich pictured there, but had no words for it.",
  "I kept saying, there, that one.",
  "The man dressed like a woman.",
  "It’s hard to get served when one understands the signifier as a process.",
  "Still high on those brownies, but coming down.",
  "I’ve eaten, in the past twenty-four hours, so very many burgers and chicken sandwiches.",
  "The Sea of Coke is heavy today with meat—its cold swells with the meaty goodness that objects to language.",
  "Some kids drift by, talking.",
  "One of them says, that sucks dead donkey dicks, and the other agrees.",
  "Naturally I think about smashing the skulls and the rib-cages of the other customers.",
  "They stand in line so smug—like they were safe, outside the desires of or for an other.",
  "It’s as if, for them, there is no other’s desire—as if desire was one thing, and was ours.",
  "Restraining myself is not dishonest.",
  "It’s a way of maintaining a keen sense of the unforeseeable injuries which shall certainly reunite us.",
  "It would bring me to despair to think that I could get a Frosty in my own kitchen.",
  "I need believe that a Frosty can only be gotten outside of where I ordinarily dwell.",
  "To be constantly in the place of real Frosties—this is unthinkable, somehow unbearable.",
  "The fact is: to be a subject of language is to desire an Event, and an Event needs a nothing to move out of, to seem to begin.",
  "I eavesdrop on people at Wendy’s.",
  "I notice they never talk about their assholes.",
  "It’s not that I think an asshole, as an abstract as Platonic form if you will, is so interesting.",
  "It’s specific assholes that are interesting—my asshole as compared with Nick’s, yours as compared with Ted’s or Mary’s.",
  "How one experiences another’s asshole speaks volumes—it seems selfish not to make these volumes readily available.",
  "This idiotic notion that one should love the other customers.",
  "Love here really only means: agree, for the time being, not to attack.",
  "People pretend, though, that each customer is an irreplaceable piece of some priceless puzzle—like the death of each customer is significant for every other customer.",
  "It’s just not true; one cannot love what one does not know, and—fortunately—one knows very little.",
  "I can say without hesitation that if Wendy’s ever started to deliver I would end my life.",
  "And in a way, my suicide would mimic Wendy’s decision to deliver.",
  "That is, I would decide that my blood, which, in my body, made sense, should flow out in to the dust, where it makes just more dust.",
  "Our homes are dust?",
  "Yes, our homes are dust.",
  "Don’t pretend you are surprised.",
  "I’ve been sort of hesitant to mention this, but I believe that one of your employees—you must know the one I speak of—is a beaver.",
  "It’s impossible to look into her face, to hear the sounds she makes, and to see the way she moves, the way she carries bits of wood, and to not feel that this is a beaver.",
  "I’ve not mentioned this before because, obviously, beavers are powerful creatures.",
  "These fucking teeny-bopper cunts—they’ll steal your man as soon as look at you.",
  "Even if you don’t have a man, they’ll steal him.",
  "They’ll steal him and they’ll take him back to their fucking teeny-bopper bedroom.",
  "Then they’ll suck his dick real slow as though they’ve never sucked a dick before and they’ll say, it’s so big.",
  "Even if it isn’t.",
  "And then afterwards they’ll act like they never said it was big at all.",
  "As I look around the restaurant at all the beautiful folks enjoying themselves, I wonder what catastrophe awaits each one.",
  "Young man, will your heart explode?",
  "Will your intestines fill with blood?",
  "Perhaps a seizure on a boat in the middle of a lake.",
  "The sun shining down.",

  "One morning St. Joseph, in excellent humor, with his halo of glory upon his head, a new cloak upon his back, bright new sandals upon his feet, and his long flowering staff to aid him, went out for a walk through the village in which Juan Bueno lived and suffered.",
  "Christmas night was near, and St. Joseph was thinking about his baby, Jesus, and the preparations for his birth; he strolled along blessing the good believers and from time to time softly humming some carol or another.",
  "As he was walking along one street he heard a great racket, and much moaning and lamenting, and he found—oh, grievous sight. —Juan Bueno’s wife, bam, bam, bam, giving her wretched spouse what-for.",
  "Called out the putative father of the divine Savior.",
  "I’ll have no such rows in my presence.",
  "Just that short and sweet.",

  "Happy as could be, was good Juan Bueno at these tidings.",
  "And it may well be imagined that he went off, day after day, almost hour after hour, to visit the shoulder he knew he could cry on. —Lord, this has happened.",
  "Lord, this other.",
  "Lord, can you imagine what’s happened now.",
  "He asked for everything, and everything was granted.",
  "Well, not quite everything, because he was too embarrassed to tell the saint that his tyrant of a wife had not lost the habit of boxing his ears.",
  "So when St. Joseph would ask him, What’s that bump on your head there?",
  "He would laugh and change the subject.",
  "But St. Joseph knew very well.",
  "And he admired Juan’s forbearance.",
  "One day Juan came in terribly sad and downcast.",
  "I’ve lost, he moaned, a bag of silver I’d put away.",
  "Could you find it for me?",
  "Well, that’s really St. Anthony’s job, but we’ll see what we can do.",

  "From his mother he inherited the instinct for revolt and luxury, the fear of death, the thrill of passion and the hate of kings.",
  "His father bequeathed him his desire for a crown, his pride of power and his joy of creating.",
  "To him both parents handed down their taste for nocturnal things, for a red glare in the night, and for blood.",
  "The exact date of his birth is not known, though we are told that he appeared one dark day during a pestilential year.",
  "No celestial protector watched over the woman whose body was swollen with this infant god, for the plague touched her several days before her confinement, and the door of her little house was marked with a red cross.",
  "At the moment when Cyril Tourneur was coming into the world the sexton at the cemetery began to toll the bell for the burial of the dead.",
  "Then, quite as his father had disappeared into that heaven common to all gods, so a green cart dragged his mother away to the common grave of men.",
  "That night is said to have been so dark that the sexton had to hold a torch by the pesthouse door while the grim carter gathered his load.",

  "It is impossible to discover what were his thoughts or habits before he reached the age of thirty.",
  "The signs of his latent divinity had no record, nor do we know how he first recognized his hidden sovereignty.",
  "An obscure list of his blasphemies has come to light.",
  "From this document we know that he declared Moses nothing more than a juggler, while one named Heriot, he said, was an infinitely cleverer juggler than Moses.",
  "The beginning of religion, according to Cyril, consisted in terrorizing man.",
  "Christ, he held, merited death more than Barabbas, though Barabbas were thief and murderer.",
  "Should he, Cyril Tourneur, write a new religion, he said, he could vow to establish it upon a finer, more admirable basis.",
  "He thought the style of the New Testament wholly repugnant.",
  "He declared that his right to coin money was as good as the queen of England’s, and furthermore, that he knew a man named Poole, a prisoner at Newgate, with whose aid he meant some day to strike gold pieces in his own image.",
  "A pious soul has erased the more terrible affirmations from this document.",
  "Cyril Tourneur’s words have been overheard and his gestures thought to indicate an atheism even more vindictive.",
  "He has been represented to us cloaked in a long black robe, a glorious twelve-starred crown on his head, his feet resting on the celestial sphere while he holds the terrestrial globe in his right hand.",
  "Pale as a wax taper on an altar, with eyes deeply aglow like burning incense, he walked the streets on stormy nights when the pest was over the city.",
  "Some have said he had a strange mark like a seal on his right thigh, but the point will never be verified since no one saw his body naked after death.",
  "For mistress he took a prostitute from Bankside, a girl who had haunted the waterfront streets.",
  "He called her Rosamonde.",
  "His love for her was unique.",
  "On her blonde, innocent face the rouge spots burned like flickering flames, and she was very young.",
  "Rosamonde bore Cyril Tourneur a daughter whom he loved.",
  "Having been looked at by a prince, Rosamonde died tragically, drinking emerald-coloured poison from a transparent cup.",
  "Vengeance merged with pride in Cyril’s soul.",
  "He walked the Mall, down the full length of that royal promenade, flourishing a torch of burning horsehair to illuminate his face, this poisoner prince.",
  "Hatred of all who reign was in his mouth and on his hands.",
  "So he became a highwayman, not to steal but to assassinate kings.",
  "Various princes who disappeared in those days were lighted to their death by Cyril Tourneur’s torch before he killed them.",
  "He would lie in wait along the queen’s highway, hiding near some gravel pit or lime kiln.",
  "Selecting his victim from a group of travellers, he would offer to guide the gentleman through the quagmires.",
  "At the mouth of the pit he would extinguish his torch and hurl the unsuspecting man into the black hole.",
  "The gravel always gave way under their feet and Cyril would roll two enormous stones down to stifle the cries.",
  "In the dull glow of the kiln, he would sit through the night watching the cadaver as the lime consumed it.",
  "When Cyril Tourneur had thus satisfied his hatred for kings he was assailed by his hatred of the gods.",
  "The divine spark within him urged him on to original creation.",
  "He dreamed of founding an entire generation out of his own blood—a race of gods on earth.",
  "He looked at his daughter.",
  "She was pure and desirable.",
  "To carry out his plan under the eyes of heaven he chose a cemetery as the most appropriate scene.",
  "Vowing to brave death and create a new humanity in the heart of that destruction decreed by the gods, Cyril Tourneur sought among old, dead bones to engender new ones.",
  "He carried out this project on the roof of a charnelhouse.",
  "The end of his life is lost in a haze of obscurity.",

  "Several persons have seen him sitting there with his gold crown on his head, though they all ran away, frightened by the long blue aigrettes waving to and fro above him.",
  "He read the poems of Empedocles in the manuscript.",
  "He often expressed his admiration for the manner in which the ancient poet died.",
  "No one saw the manuscript of Empedocles after Cyril Tourneur disappeared.",
  "That year the plague was come again, and the people of London took refuge on barges floating midstream in the Thames.",
  "One night a meteor flashed across the face of the moon.",
  "Moving with a sinister roar it whirled like a globe of white fire toward Cyril Tourneur’s house.",
  "On his black throne, in his black robes and his golden crown, the man waited for the comet.",
  "Like a battle on the stage, an ominous blast of trumpets sounded a funereal fanfare across the night.",
  "In a shimmering, sanguine blaze, Cyril Tourneur was borne away to some unknown god in the somber, stormy regions of the sky.",
  "I saw Stéphane Mallarmé for the last time on the 14th of July, 1898, at Valvins.",
  "When lunch was over, he took me into his study.",
  "Four paces long by two paces wide; the window opening onto the Seine and onto the forest through foliage rent apart by light, and the smallest movements of the shining river faintly reflected on the walls.",
  "Mallarmé was worried about the finishing touches to the construction of the Coup de Dés.",
  "The inventor was contem-plating and touching up with a pencil this new machine which the Lahure Press had agreed to construct.",
  "Nothing had so far been undertaken—or even considered—to give the form of the text a significance and an effect comparable to those of the text itself.",
  "Just as the everyday use of our limbs makes us almost forget their existence and neglect the variety of their resources, and just as it happens that an artist in the use of the human body sometimes points out to us all their suppleness, at the cost of his life which he consumes in exercises and which he exposes to the dangers of his addiction, so the habitual use of language, the practice of reading at random, and the use of everyday expressions, weaken the understanding of these too familiar acts and banish the very conception of their power and of their possible perfection, unless some person survives and dedicates himself who is particularly disdainful of the easy ways of the mind, but singularly attentive to what he can produce that is most unexpected and most subtle.",
  "I was in the presence of such a person.",
  "Nothing told me that I should never see him again.",
  "On this golden day there was no raven to foretell it.",
  "Everything was calm and certain.",
  ". But while Mallarmé was talking to me, with his finger on the page, I remember that my mind began to contemplate this particular moment.",
  "Absent-mindedly I gave it an almost absolute value.",
  "Near him while he was still alive, I thought of his destiny as already realized.",
  "Born for the delight of some and to the dismay of others, and to the amazement of all; for the latter a madness and an absurdity; for his own kind a marvel of pride, elegance and intellectual modesty, a few poems had sufficed for him to put in doubt the very purpose of literature.",
  "His work, difficult to understand and impossible to neglect, divided literate people.",
  "Poor and without honors, the nakedness of his condition disgraced all the advantages that others had; but he was assured, without having looked for it, of extraordinary loyalty.",
  "As for him, whose wise, disdainful victim’s smile quietly disposed of the universe, he had never asked anything of the world but the most precious and rarest things it contained.",
  "He found them in himself.",
  "We went into the country.",
  "The artificial poet gathered the simplest flowers.",
  "Our arms were filled with corn-flowers and poppies.",
  "The air was on fire; the splendor absolute; the silence full of intoxication and communication; death impossible or unimportant; everything amazingly beautiful, afire and asleep; and the landscape trembled.",
  "In the sun, in the immense arc of the cloudless sky, I dreamed of an incandescent space where nothing distinct exists, where nothing lasts, but where nothing ends, as if destruction itself was destroyed before it was accomplished.",
  "I lost my perception of the difference between being and not-being.",
  "Sometimes music gives us this impression, which is beyond all others.",
  "Is not poetry, I thought, the supreme pastime of transmuting ideas?.",
  "Mallarmé pointed out to me the plain which summer was already beginning to turn to gold; Look, he said, it is the first drum-beat of autumn on the earth.",
  "When autumn came, he was no more.",
  "A Sunday rain was falling, completely by mistake, since it was Tuesday, the dry day of the week par excellence.",
  "Even so, nothing was happening: the all-out-strike order of things was carried out without incident.",
  "Without disturbing this embroiled state of affairs I pushed back my chair, making the noise with which a petty tyrant under-assistant-bureaucrat sets twenty underlings quaking in their boots and yawning.",
  "I took my rack from its hat and, putting both arms into the sleeves, wound the calendar, ripped that day’s leaf from the clock, put some coal in the icebox, added ice to the stove, supplemented the wall thermometer with all the thermometers I had handy just to ward off an approaching cold spell, and, as a streetcar ran catchably by, I sprang to the sidewalk and fell comfortably into my desk easy chair.",
  "Here was a matter for thought: the days were going by all at once and yet no light was shed on the mystery no one knew that there was one of the forthcoming bridge.",
  "First: we were shown a diagram of the bridge, showing how far construction had progressed, before anyone had even thought of bringing it into existence; second: a sketch of what the bridge was like when somebody was thinking of it; third: a photograph of someone crossing the bridge; fourth: construction is begun on the first span.",
  "In short: the bridge was already finished, but it had to be extended over to the opposite bank, since due to an oversight the bridge had been built to go from one bank to the same bank of the river.",
  "And why was it that the government official, whose carefully-considered speech was dedicated, with throat-clearing eloquence, to the bridge, since one or the other of them had a slight cold, I’m not sure which one, accuse it of ingratitude toward the government?",
  "You don’t need to be reminded how humanity has suffered from the ingratitude of bridges.",
  "Yet, in this case, where did the ingratitude lie?",
  "Surely not over on the other side of the river, because the bridge didn’t lead to that side and, in truth, the great labor that lay at hand was to get the water to flow under the bridge.",
  "It was the least that could be demanded and expected of a river that had so far played no part in the bridge effort.",
  "Aphorisms are never congruent with the truth: they are either half-truths or one-and-a-half.",
  "My wish that my things be read twice has aroused great bitterness.",
  "Unjustly so; the wish is modest.",
  "It is not as if I asked that they be read once.",

  "I have risen from the place where I slept under a tree but cannot shake the sleep out of my eyes.",
  "The nights in the valley of the Mississippi River are staring nights.",
  "They look at men with the pupils extended.",
  "The skies are empty over the cities and the plains.",
  "The skies have not formulated a thought that I can breathe into my being.",
  "In the whole valley of the Mississippi River there is no bed of thought in which I can lie.",
  "There are farm women living in houses that stand beside dusty roads in Illinois and Iowa.",
  "In Indiana and Ohio there are many towns.",
  "In Michigan—far up where the valley is no more and where the cold finger of the north touches the earth in September—there are men living who wear heavy boots and fur caps and who walk all day under naked trees.",
  "Everywhere are men and women who arouse wonder in me.",
  "I have awakened the feeling of wonder in myself.",
  "I have awakened from sleeping under a tree.",
  "During a performance at the Opéra of For the Crown, when Desdemona sings My father is in Goritz and my heart is in Paris, a shot was heard in a box on the fifth balcony, then another in the orchestra and instantly rope ladders were uncoiled; a man climbed down from the top of the house: a bullet stopped him on the balcony level.",
  "The whole audience was armed and it turned out the hall was filled with nothing but.",
  "Then neighbors were murdered, jets of liquid fire.",
  "There was the siege of the boxes, the siege of the stage, the siege of a folding chair and the battle lasted eighteen days.",
  "Maybe the two camps were resupplied, I don’t know, but what I know for sure is the newsmen all came for the grim performance, that one of them, being sick, sent his dear mother and she was deeply impressed by the sang-froid of a young French gentleman who held out for eighteen days in a proscenium box on nothing more than a little bouillon.",
  "This episode of the War of the Balconies did a lot for voluntary enlistments in the provinces.",
  "And I know of three brothers in brand-new uniforms, on my river bank, under my trees, who embraced each other dry-eyed while their families searched for sweaters in attic armoires.",
  "A demagogue and a demi-mondaine chanced to arrive together at the gate of Paradise.",
  "And the Saint looked sorrowfully at them both.",
  "Why were you a demagogue?",
  "He said to the first.",
  "Because, said the demagogue, I stood for those principles that have made us what we are and have endeared our Party to the great heart of the people.",
  "In a word I stood unflinchingly on the plank of popular representation.",
  "Said the Saint to her of the demi-monde.",
  "I wanted money, said the demi-mondaine.",
  "And after some moments thought the Saint said: Well, come in; though you don’t deserve to.",
  "But to the demagogue he said: We genuinely regret that the limited space at our disposal and our unfortunate lack of interest in those Questions that you have gone so far to inculcate and have so ably upheld in the past, prevent us from giving you the support for which you seek.",
  "And he shut the golden door.",
  "This is a simple world.",
  "On either hand the shore sweeps out in a long curve and ends in a perpendicular, ash-coloured cliff, carving the misty air as with a hatchet-stroke.",
  "The shore is of tawny, terraced sand, like hammered metal from the prints of the retreating waves; and here and there a group of wildly carved and tragic stones—unde homines nati, durum genus— such as must have been those stones from which Deucalion made the stony race of men to arise.",
  "Up over the sand, and among these stones the water slides in tracery like May blossom or silver mail.",
  "A little way out, the long wave lifts itself up laboriously into a shadowy cliff, nods proudly and crumbles, vain and swift, into a thousand sparks of foam.",
  "Far out the desolate, ridgy leagues vibrate and murmur with an unintelligible voice, not less intelligible than when one man says, I believe, or another man, I love, or another, I am your friend.",
  "Almost at the horizon a sharp white sail sways, invisibly controlled.",
  "In a minute it does not move; in half an hour it has moved.",
  "It fascinates and becomes the image of the watcher’s hopes, as when in some tranquil grief we wait, with faint curiosity and sad foretelling, to see how our plans will travel, smiling a little even when they stray or stop, because we have foretold it.",
  "Will the sail sink?",
  "Will it take wing into the sky?",
  "Will it go straight and far, and overcome and celebrate its success?",
  "But it only fades away, and presently another is there unasked, yet not surprising, and it also fades away, and the night has come, and still the sea speaks with tongues.",
  "In the moonlight one strange flower glistens, white as a campanula, like a sweet-pea in shape—the bleached thigh-bone of a rat— and we forget the rest.",
  "I am a poor, young, unemployed person in the business field, my name is Wenzel, I am seeking a suitable position, and I take the liberty of asking you, nicely and politely, if perhaps in your airy, bright, amiable rooms such a position might be free.",
  "I know that your good firm is large, proud, old, and rich, thus I may yield to the pleasing supposition that a nice, easy, pretty little place would be available, into which, as into a kind of warm cubbyhole, I can slip.",
  "I am excellently suited, you should know, to occupy just such a modest haven, for my nature is altogether delicate, and I am essentially a quiet, polite, and dreamy child, who is made to feel cheerful by people thinking of him that he does not ask for much, and allowing him to take possession of a very, very small patch of existence, where he can be useful in his own way and thus feel at ease.",
  "A quiet, sweet, small place in the shade has always been the tender substance of all my dreams, and if now the illusions I have about you grow so intense as to make me hope that my dream, young and old, might be transformed into delicious, vivid reality, then you have, in me, the most zealous and most loyal servitor, who will take it as a matter of conscience to discharge precisely and punctually all his duties.",
  "Large and difficult tasks I cannot perform, and obligations of a far-ranging sort are too strenuous for my mind.",
  "I am not particularly clever, and first and foremost I do not like to strain my intelligence overmuch.",
  "I am a dreamer rather than a thinker, a zero rather than a force, dim rather than sharp.",
  "Assuredly there exists in your extensive institution, which I imagine to be overflowing with main and subsidiary functions and offices, work of the kind that one can do as in a dream? —I am, to put it frankly, a Chinese; that is to say, a person who deems everything small and modest to be beautiful and pleasing, and to whom all that is big and exacting is fearsome and horrid.",
  "I know only the need to feel at my ease, so that each day I can thank God for life’s boon, with all its blessings.",
  "The passion to go far in the world is unknown to me.",
  "Africa with its deserts is to me not more foreign.",
  "Well, so now you know what sort of a person I am. —I write, as you see, a graceful and fluent hand, and you need not imagine me to be entirely without intelligence.",
  "My mind is clear, but it refuses to grasp things that are many, or too many by far, shunning them.",
  "I am sincere and honest, and I am aware that this signifies precious little in the world in which we live, so I shall be waiting, esteemed gentlemen, to see what it will be your pleasure to reply to your respectful servant, positively drowning in obedience.",
  "The magician’s industry, which in our time is taking on the proportions of one of the most enjoyable arts—I’d almost say one of the most useful to high society—magic, had to undergo numerous transformations to get out of the ruts laid down by charlatanism and routine.",
  "The abuse seen in this last century, with table-turning, all kinds of mediums, hypnotism, cards, offhand palmistry, coffee grounds often harmful to the health, as in Turkey, for example, have given birth to troublesome and often exaggerated prejudices.",
  "The magician has been replaced by the fortune teller, if not by the clairvoyant.",
  "But since the magician, refusing to compete with these absurd rivals, calls for surprising combinations from science and the fine arts, concerns himself above all with hygiene, studies the raw materials, arranges them in a rational manner, since finally magic has taken on new forms in perfect harmony with good taste and reason, these prejudices have greatly diminished.",
  "They will disappear completely when creations made for the theatre and costume parties are distinguished from those destined for good company.",
  "For the former, the recipes for fast results, but too violent to endure.",
  "For the salons, the simple and suave combinations, the serious methods, which, without appearing to do so, master destiny, and which, in short, confer power and talent.",
  "Considered from this double point of view, the magician’s art merits the esteem and the interest of sensible people.",
  "I hope to show one proof of this in these recipes chosen for use by society people.",
  "It’s very easy to make.",
  "You take several fillets of sole—new shoes are not necessary, old ones being fine for this use: in fact the sole should be aged well.",
  "Take every precaution that the sole not take on your odor as you clean it—to do so, dredge your hands in flour beforehand.",
  "Cut the sole into pieces and put them in a basket in the oven.",
  "When they have lost all their moisture, grind them up in a mortar and pass the dust through a very fine sieve.",
  "Finally, mix it with a solution of horse fat.",
  "You’ll be delighted with it.",
  "It sometimes happens that such-and-such a young man— nearly a child—becomes highly successful in the salons with his metrics or with others metrics, and one would wish to do the same.",
  "Go to work for the gas company and you’ll learn all about meters; if the recipe doesn’t succeed, go to a gymnasium and learn about isometrics; and if that fails, study the metric system.",
  "Another recipe for poetry You should always carry an umbrella you never open.",
  "Revealed by M.",
  "André B., this recipe is supposed to have been entrusted to him by our dear M.",
  "P. F., prince of poets.",
  "Take three pounds of freshly picked ice leaves.",
  "Peel them and spread them to dry somewhat; do not forget to stir from time to time so they won’t warm up.",
  "Next let them marinate in twelve quarts of good Orléans vinegar.",
  "Then distill in a double boiler, over a medium heat at the start.",
  "You will easily obtain eight quarts from this operation and pennies will rain down in abundance.",
  "Shake well before using, then wash your feet thoroughly with it.",
  "It should be added that trustworthy people, among whom M.",
  "René Dalize, have used some of these recipes and have acknowledged their complete effectiveness.",
  "On the beach they’ve dug out a little pit with their hands, and from a sack of black earth they’re pouring in fat earthworms; the loose black earth and the mass of worms make for an obscure, moldy, enticing ugliness in the clean white sand.",
  "Beside this a very tidy looking wooden chest is placed.",
  "It looks like a long, not particularly wide drawer or counting board, and is full of clean yarn; and on the other side of the pit another such, but empty, drawer is placed.",
  "The hundred hooks attached to the yarn in the one drawer are neatly arranged on the end of a small iron pole and are now being unfastened one after the other and laid in the empty drawer, the bottom of which is filled with nothing but clean wet sand.",
  "A very tidy operation.",
  "In the meantime, however, four long, lean and strong hands oversee the process as carefully as nurses to make sure that each hook gets a worm.",
  "The men who do this crouch two by two on knees and heels, with mighty, bony backs, long, kindly faces, and pipes in their mouths.",
  "They exchange incomprehensible words that flow forth as softly as the motion of their hands.",
  "One of them takes up a fat earthworm with two fingers, tears it into three pieces with the same two fingers of the other hand, as easily and exactly as a shoemaker snips off the paper band after he’s taken the measurement; the other one then presses these squirming pieces calmly and carefully onto each hook.",
  "This having been accomplished, the worms are then doused with water and laid in neat little beds, one next to the other, in the drawer with the soft sand, where they can die without immediately losing their freshness.",
  "It is a quiet, delicate activity, whereby the coarse fishermen’s fingers step softly as on tiptoes.",
  "You have to pay close attention.",
  "In fair weather the dark blue sky arches above and the seagulls circle high over the land like white swallows.",
  "Signs in the sky that make one dizzy with color.",
  "New constellations: The Pig, all green, dancing and waving greetings to the left and right with his straw hat, the Bottle which pops its ruddy cork with a muted detonation against a sun with eyes and a mouth, the Electric Stocking which dances madly by itself like a tail separated from a salamander, the Scotchman who displays and pours his whiskey with its white reflections, the Fountain of mallow-pink and orange water through whose shower, like a snake, pass hills and valleys of wavering sun and shade, links of gold and iron that braid a shower of light and another of darkness.",
  ". . , the Book which illuminates and extinguishes the successive imbecilities of its owner, the Ship which every moment, as it lights up, sails pitching toward its prison, to run aground immediately in the darkness.",
  "Look at it between those two tall buildings over there, above the river, over the red octave beneath, don’t you see it?",
  "Wait, let’s see.",
  "Is it the moon or just an advertisement of the moon?",
  "Whatever hour you woke there was a door shutting.",
  "From room to room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure—a ghostly couple.",
  "Here we left it, she said.",
  "And he added, Oh, but here too.",
  "It’s upstairs, she murmured.",
  "And in the garden, he whispered.",
  "Quietly, they said, or we shall wake them.",
  "But it wasn’t that you woke us.",
  "They’re looking for it; they’re drawing the curtain, one might say, and so read on a page or two.",
  "Now they’ve found it, one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the margin.",
  "And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm.",
  "What did I come in here for?",
  "What did I want to find?",
  "My hands were empty.",
  "Perhaps its upstairs then?",
  "The apples were in the loft.",
  "And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass.",
  "But they had found it in the drawing-room.",
  "Not that one could ever see them.",
  "The windowpanes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass.",
  "If they moved in the drawing-room, the apple only turned its yellow side.",
  "Yet, the moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling—what?",
  "My hands were empty.",
  "The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound.",
  "Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat softly.",
  "The treasure buried; the room.",
  "The pulse stopped short.",
  "Oh, was that the buried treasure?",
  "A moment later the light had faded.",
  "Out in the garden then?",
  "But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun.",
  "So fine, so rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burnt behind the glass.",
  "Death was the glass; death was between us; coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened.",
  "He left it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs.",
  "Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat gladly.",
  "The Treasure yours.",
  "The wind roars up the avenue.",
  "Trees stoop and bend this way and that.",
  "Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain.",
  "But the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window.",
  "The candle burns stiff and still.",
  "Wandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy.",
  "Here we slept, she says.",
  "And he adds, Kisses without number.",
  "Waking in the morning— Silver between the trees— Upstairs— In the garden— When summer came— In winter snowtime— The doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the pulse of a heart.",
  "Nearer they come; cease at the doorway.",
  "The wind falls, the rain slides silver down the glass.",
  "Our eyes darken; we hear no steps beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak.",
  "His hands shield the lantern.",
  "Look, he breathes.",
  "Love upon their lips.",
  "Stooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply.",
  "Long they pause.",
  "The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly.",
  "Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.",
  "Safe, safe, safe, the heart of the house beats proudly.",
  "Long years— he sighs.",
  "Again you found me.",
  "Here, she murmurs, sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft.",
  "Here we left our treasure— Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes.",
  "The pulse of the house beats wildly.",
  "Waking, I cry Oh, is this your buried treasure?",
  "The light in the heart.",
  "Poseidon sat at his desk, going over the accounts.",
  "The administration of all the waters gave him endless work.",
  "He could have had as many assistants as he wanted, and indeed he had quite a number, but since he took his job very seriously he insisted on going through all the accounts again himself, and so his assistants were of little help to him.",
  "It cannot be said that he enjoyed the work; he carried it out simply because it was assigned to him; indeed he had frequently applied for what he called more cheerful work, but whenever various suggestions were put to him it turned out that nothing suited him so well as his present employment.",
  "Needless to say, it was very difficult to find him another job.",
  "After all, he could not possibly be put in charge of one particular ocean.",
  "Quite apart from the fact that in this case the work involved would not be less, only more petty, the great Poseidon could hold only a superior position.",
  "And when he was offered a post unrelated to the waters, the very idea made him feel sick, his divine breath came short and his brazen chest began to heave.",
  "As a matter of fact, no one took his troubles very seriously; when a mighty man complains one must pretend to yield, however hopeless the case may seem.",
  "No one ever really considered relieving Poseidon of his position; he had been destined to be God of the Seas since time immemorial, and that was how it had to remain.",
  "What annoyed him most—and this was the chief cause of discontent with his job—was to learn of the rumors that were circulating about him; for instance, that he was constantly cruising through the waves with his trident.",
  "Instead of which here he was sitting in the depths of the world’s ocean endlessly going over the accounts, an occasional journey to Jupiter being the only interruption of the monotony, a journey moreover from which he invariably returned in a furious temper.",
  "As a result he had hardly seen the oceans, save fleetingly during his hasty ascent to Olympus, and had never really sailed upon them.",
  "He used to say that he was postponing this until the end of the world, for then there might come a quiet moment when, just before the end and having gone through the last account, he could still make a quick little tour.",
  "One expected something different, and usually more.",
  "When it’s less, that’s annoying, but not always; it still offers something when it doesn’t really matter.",
  "Or when it’s really harmless, like a joke, which after all can also amuse when it falls flat—when it sets mountains in motion, as it were, only to bear a mouse.",
  "As happened, for example, with that scene at the circus, lots of big words, expectations ever rising.",
  "The ring was cleared and nothing less was announced than the battle steed Bucephalos.",
  "That was also the name of Alexander the Great’s personal horse.",
  "The mighty steel cable was already auspicious by which the ringmaster tried to drag the stallion into the ring.",
  "Only tried, of course; the stubborn, unseen something on the other end dragged him forward by the cable, outside, from where one could hear only stamping and angry whinnying.",
  "One, two, then three particularly brawny men came to the ringmaster’s aid, pulled expertly at the cable, in vain, could only bring the cable to a standstill.",
  "Until a fourth came along and grabbed the cable, a very heavy boxer, come to help them from the next number, and now he finally moved the cable from a standstill and pulled it ever more back.",
  "A final tug, all together, one could hear the clatter of mighty hoofs outside, triumph—and a wooden horse was visible at the end of the cable, rolled into the ring on its four wheels.",
  "The audience now laughed with relief at this great sight gag, laughed wholeheartedly, as we like to say.",
  "And not at all so disappointed at such a Bucephalos at the end of the tether.",
  "Even objectively, it was rather relieved by the humor, perhaps also because anticipation is not only joyful, but much more often fearful—and look, there was nothing to it.",
  "At least not in fairy tales; or even when something less childish comes, does not come out like a wooden horse, nevertheless fairy tales, the circus, all the way up to farce, all mean that the soup is always cooler when you eat it than when it was boiling.",
  "Whereas in the life as we still have it, the cooks in charge expect us to eat the soup even hotter.",
  "After I’d sat down in the chair, I happened to ask the young barber, occupied in fastening a clean, cool cloth around my neck, about his older colleague from the chair to the right, a spry fellow who had been sick.",
  "I didn’t ask this because I felt obliged to ask something; it was the place and my memory that sparked the question.",
  "He passed away yesterday, flatly answered the barber’s voice behind me and the linen cloth as his fingers withdrew from the final tuck of the cloth in between my shirt collar and my neck.",
  "The whole of my irrational good mood abruptly died, like the eternally missing barber from the adjacent chair.",
  "A chill swept over all my thoughts.",
  "I said nothing.",
  "I even feel it for people and things that were nothing to me, because time’s fleeing is for me an anguish, and life’s mystery is a torture.",
  "Faces I habitually see on my habitual streets—if I stop seeing them I become sad.",
  "And they were nothing to me, except perhaps the symbol of all of life.",
  "The nondescript old man with dirty gaiters who often crossed my path at nine-thirty in the morning.",
  "The crippled seller of lottery tickets who would pester me in vain.",
  "The round and ruddy old man smoking a cigar at the door of the tobacco shop.",
  "The pale tobacco shop owner.",
  "What has happened to them all, who because I regularly saw them were a part of my life?",
  "Tomorrow I too will vanish from the Rua da Prata, the Rua dos Douradores, the Rua dos Fanqueiros.",
  "Tomorrow I too—I this soul that feels and thinks, this universe I am for myself— yes, tomorrow I too will be the one who no longer walks these streets, whom others will vaguely evoke with a What’s become of him?",
  "And everything I’ve done, everything I’ve felt and everything I’ve lived will amount merely to one less passer-by on the everyday streets of some city or other.",

  "Those present, invoking a higher moral standpoint, admonish him in vain to overcome his prudery.",
  "A few minutes later he reappears, now stark naked, before the visitor.",
  "In the meantime he has washed.",
  "The power of a country road when one is walking along it is different from the power it has when one is flying over it by airplane.",
  "In the same way, the power of a text when it is read is different from the power it has when it is copied out.",
  "The airplane passenger sees only how the road pushes through the landscape, how it unfolds according to the same laws as the terrain surrounding it.",
  "Only he who walks the road on foot learns of the power it commands, and of how, from the very scenery that for the flier is only the unfurled plain, it calls forth distances, belvederes, clearings, prospects at each of its turns like a commander deploying soldiers at a front.",
  "Only the copied text thus commands the soul of him who is occupied with it, whereas the mere reader never discovers the new aspects of his inner self that are opened by the text, that road cut through the interior jungle forever closing behind it: because the reader follows the movement of his mind in the free flight of daydreaming, whereas the copier submits it to command.",
  "The Chinese practice of copying books was thus an incomparable guarantee of literary culture, and the transcript a key to China’s enigmas.",
  "Opposite the bistro where I’ve been sitting all day, an old building is being pulled down, a hotel I’ve lived in these past sixteen years—apart from such time as I was away on my travels.",
  "Yesterday one wall, the back wall, was still standing, awaiting its final night.",
  "The three other walls were already rubble, on the half-fenced-off site.",
  "How oddly small the site seemed to me, compared to the big hotel that had formerly occupied the same space.",
  "You would have thought, too, that an empty site would appear bigger than one that was built on.",
  "But probably it’s the sixteen years, now that they’re over, seeming so precious to me, so full of precious things, that I can’t understand how they could have elapsed in such a small space.",
  "And because the hotel is shattered and the years I lived in it have gone, it seems bigger in memory, much bigger than it can have been.",
  "On the one remaining wall I could still see the wallpaper in my room, which was sky blue with a fine gold pattern.",
  "Then, yesterday, they put up a scaffolding against the wall, and two workers climbed up on it.",
  "With pickax and sledgehammer they attacked my wallpaper, my wall; and then, when it was reeling and decrepit, the men tied ropes round the wall—the wall was to be put to death.",
  "The workers climbed down, dismantling the scaffolding as they went.",
  "The two ends of the rope hung down on either side of the wall.",
  "Each man took hold of one end and pulled.",
  "And with a crash the wall came down.",
  "Everything was obscured by a dense white cloud of plaster dust and mortar.",
  "From it emerged, all coated in white dust, like great millers who grind stones, the two men.",
  "They made straight for me, as they had been doing twice each day.",
  "They’ve known me since I’ve been sitting here.",
  "The younger one gestures back over his shoulder with his thumb, and says: It’s gone now, your wall.",
  "I asked them both to stop and have a drink with me, more as if they’d been building me a wall.",
  "We joked about the wallpaper, the walls, my precious years.",
  "The workers were demolition men; knocking things down was their job; they would never think of building anything.",
  "And quite right too.",
  "Everyone does the job they do, and gets paid the going rate.",
  "And this man here is the king of the demolition men, said the younger one.",
  "The older one smiled.",
  "That’s how cheerful the destroyers were, and I with them.",
  "Now I’m sitting facing the vacant lot, and hearing the hours go by.",
  "You lose one home after another, I say to myself.",
  "Here I am, sitting with my wanderer’s staff.",
  "My feet are sore, my heart is tired, my eyes are dry.",
  "Misery crouches beside me, ever larger and ever gentler; pain takes an interest, becomes huge and kind; terror flutters up, and it doesn’t even frighten me anymore.",
  "And that’s the most desolate thing of all.",
  "Unimaginable things happen, and the hand remains calm and doesn’t clutch at the head.",
  "On my right is the little post office; the postman comes out and delivers my letters, bad letters mostly; when the hotel was still standing, he used to leave good letters on my table.",
  "A woman comes—one I used to love, and I smile, a shadow of an old smile I used to have, that I no longer miss.",
  "An old man shuffles by, wearing a pair of indoor slippers, and I envy him his shuffle and his being an old man.",
  "Boisterous customers stand around the bar, arguing.",
  "There is a series of unresolvable, albeit not-very-far-reaching differences of opinion between them on such matters as cigarette lighters, radios, racehorses, wives, makes of car, aperitifs, and other such weighty issues.",
  "A taxi driver walks in.",
  "The waiter brings him a glass of red wine.",
  "His taxi’s waiting.",
  "The driver drinks his wine.",
  "Soon he’s quite alone, facing the landlady across the bar.",
  "The waiter balances an empty can on a car tire.",
  "The guests laugh.",
  "They want me to laugh with them.",
  "I stand up, and I laugh.",
  "Who’s that laughing in me?",
  "I’ve got misery waiting at my table, large, gentle misery.",
  "I won’t be long, I’m just laughing.",
  "Diagonally across from me is the barber, standing in front of his door, as white as a candle.",
  "Soon his customers will arrive, they will arrive at the end of their day’s work, when the newspaper seller comes and brings me the evening papers, the ones that are full of heated skirmishes and cold blood, and that yet—one can’t really believe it—flop rustling home on to the tables on the terrace like huge, exhausted peace doves at the end of their day.",
  "All the terror of the world is in them, all the terror of the whole grisly day, that’s what makes them so tired.",
  "When the first silvery streetlights glimmer on, a refugee, an exile, sometimes comes along, without a wanderer’s staff, quite as if he were at home here, and—as if he wanted to prove to me in one breath that he felt at home, that he knew his way around, but also that where he felt at home wasn’t home—he says: I know somewhere you can get a good, cheap meal here.",
  "And I’m glad for him that he does.",
  "I’m glad that he walks off under the trail of silvery streetlights, and doesn’t stop, now that night is falling, to take in the ever-ghost-lier-looking dust on the empty lot opposite.",
  "Not everyone has to get used to rubble and to shattered walls.",
  "The exile, the displaced person, has taken the newspapers away with him.",
  "He wants to read them in his good, cheap restaurant.",
  "In front of me the table is empty.",
  "A fox, attracted by the scent of something, followed his nose to a tree in which sat a crow with a piece of cheese in his beak.",
  "Oh, cheese, said the fox scornfully.",
  "That’s for mice.",
  "The crow removed the cheese with his talons and said, You always hate the thing you cannot have, as, for instance, grapes.",
  "Grapes are for the birds, said the fox haughtily.",
  "I am an epicure, a gourmet, and a gastronome.",
  "The embarrassed crow, ashamed to be seen eating mouse food by a great specialist in the art of dining, hastily dropped the cheese.",
  "The fox caught it deftly, swallowed it with relish, said Merci, politely, and trotted away.",
  "A fox had used all his blandishments in vain, for he could not flatter the crow in the tree and make him drop the cheese he held in his beak.",
  "Suddenly, the crow tossed the cheese to the astonished fox.",
  "Just then the farmer, from whose kitchen the loot had been stolen, appeared, carrying a rifle, looking for the robber.",
  "The fox turned and ran for the woods.",
  "There goes the guilty son of a vixen now.",
  "Cried the crow, who, in case you do not happen to know it, can see the glint of sunlight on a gun barrel at a greater distance than anybody. This time the fox, who was determined not to be outfoxed by a crow, stood his ground and did not run when the farmer appeared, carrying a rifle and looking for the robber.",
  "The teeth marks in this cheese are mine, said the fox, but the beak marks were made by the true culprit up there in the tree.",
  "I submit this cheese in evidence, as Exhibit A, and bid you and the criminal a very good day.",
  "Whereupon he lit a cigarette and strolled away.",
  "In the great and ancient tradition, the crow in the tree with the cheese in his beak began singing, and the cheese fell into the fox’s lap.",
  "You sing like a shovel, said the fox, with a grin, but the crow pretended not to hear and cried out, Quick, give me back the cheese.",
  "Here comes the farmer with his rifle.",
  "Why should I give you back the cheese?",
  "The wily fox demanded.",
  "Because the farmer has a gun, and I can fly faster than you can run.",
  "So the frightened fox tossed the cheese back to the crow, who ate it, and said, Dearie me, my eyes are playing tricks on me or am I playing tricks on you?",
  "Which do you think?",
  "But there was no reply, for the fox had slunk away into the woods.",
  "Men had always wanted her, this Karintha, even as a child, Karintha carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down.",
  "Old men rode her hobby-horse upon their knees.",
  "Young men danced with her at frolics when they should have been dancing with their grown-up girls.",
  "God grant us youth, secretly prayed the old men.",
  "The young fellows counted the time to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them.",
  "This interest of the male, who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon, could mean no good to her.",
  "Karintha, at twelve, was a wild flash that told the other folks just what it was to live.",
  "At sunset, when there was no wind, and the pine-smoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth, and you couldn’t see more than a few feet in front, her sudden darting past you was a bit of vivid color, like a black bird that flashes in light.",
  "With the other children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping in the two-inch dust.",
  "Karintha’s running was a whir.",
  "It had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road.",
  "At dusk, during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before any of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her voice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one’s ears to itching.",
  "But no one ever thought to make her stop because of it.",
  "She stoned the cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children.",
  "Even the preacher, who caught her at her mischief, told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a November cotton flower.",
  "Already, rumors were out about her.",
  "Homes in Georgia are most often built on the two-room plan.",
  "In one, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on.",
  "Karintha had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving.",
  "One could but imitate one’s parents, for to follow them was the way of God.",
  "She played home with a small boy who was not afraid to do her bidding.",
  "That started the whole thing.",
  "Old men could no longer ride her hobby-horse upon their knees.",
  "But young men counted faster.",
  "Karintha is a woman.",
  "She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down.",
  "She has been married many times.",
  "Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees.",
  "Karintha smiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it.",
  "She has contempt for them.",
  "Karintha is a woman.",
  "Young men run stills to make her money.",
  "Young men go to the big cities and run on the road.",
  "Young men go away to college.",
  "They all want to bring her money.",
  "These are the young men who thought that all they had to was to count time.",
  "But Karintha is a woman, and she has had a child.",
  "A child fell out of her womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest.",
  "Pine-needles are smooth and sweet.",
  "They are elastic to the feet of rabbits.",
  "A sawmill was nearby.",
  "Its pyramidal saw-dust pile smouldered.",
  "It is a year before one completely burns.",
  "Meanwhile, the smoke curls up and hangs in odd wraiths about the trees, curls up, and spreads itself out over the valley.",
  "Weeks after Karintha returned home the smoke was so heavy you tasted it in water.",
  "Some one made a song: Karintha is a woman.",
  "Men do not know that the soul of her was a growing thing ripened too soon.",
  "They will bring their money; they will die not having found it out.",
  "Karintha at twenty, carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down.",
  "Last Saturday after work I dropped by the shops.",
  "I had to buy a shirt.",
  "On Sunday there was going to be a party at our place.",
  "I felt like dressing up a bit.",
  "I fancied buying some kind of a shirt that was a bit special.",
  "Some kind of fantasy shirt.",
  "I chose one.",
  "A sort of sky-blue colour, with two detachable collars.",
  "Well, it was every bit as good as imported goods.",
  "I headed off home as fast as I could.",
  "Tried it on.",
  "A lovely sight.",
  "A joy to behold.",
  "At the party I thought, the ladies would be throwing themselves at me.",
  "I should admit, I’m fanatical about cleanliness.",
  "There I was trying on the shirt, and somehow I felt uncomfortable.",
  "God only knows, I thought.",
  "You never know how many people have had their hands all over it.",
  "Wouldn’t be a bad idea to get it laundered.",
  "We’re only talking about twenty kopecks.",
  "Then I could wear it with pleasure.",
  "I ran over to the laundry woman.",
  "She lives in the same yard as me.",
  "My dear Lukerya Petrovna, I said, please do your best.",
  "The party’s tomorrow.",
  "I’ve got to have it for tomorrow.",
  "Can I rely on you?",
  "You can rely on me, she said.",
  "Come round, she said, just before the party and you can put your shirt on.",
  "It will be washed and pressed, with the two detachable collars.",
  "The next day, before the party, I popped round to the laundry woman.",
  "I took the shirt from her.",
  "I ran off to get changed.",
  "I put the shirt on.",
  "But what on earth was this?",
  "Some kind of tiny shirt: the collar wouldn’t fit and the cuffs were where the elbows had been.",
  "What the hell was going on?",
  "I quickly hurried back to the laundry woman.",
  "The laundry woman said: That’s nothing unusual.",
  "It’s only to be expected.",
  "New shirts these days always shrink.",
  "Either it’s the material they’re made from or the manufacturers don’t wash the fabric.",
  "What do you mean nothing.",
  "It won’t fit round my neck.",
  "It used to be, I said, size 38, and now it’s probably a 32.",
  "The laundry woman said: And you can thank your lucky stars for that, she said.",
  "The other day I washed one for the accountant, started off size 40 and now he’ll be lucky if it’s a five.",
  "The accountant threatened to smash my face in for that, but it’s not my fault.",
  "What, I thought, can I do?",
  "And I didn’t have much time.",
  "It was time to go to the party.",
  "I put the shirt on, and over it, to hide it, I squeezed on my old shirt, so as not to cause offence, and hurried off to the party.",
  "It went well.",
  "No one noticed.",
  "It was OK.",
  "------PAUL COLINET Belgium, 1898–1957 The Lobster The lobster is a bird on stilts, in the species of nighthawks.",
  "He drinks cranially, is well developed, has been pointed out by Linné under the name of Forge Roussel.",
  "Its body shows 4/5 generally animal.",
  "The hindquarters are composed of a cluster of 17 metal spools, on divergent axles.",
  "The lobster is the only carnivorous bird that flies backwards.",
  "His characteristic song, which resembles, but is harsher than, the civet-cat’s, is produced by a spur’s vibration in the cranial box, called the sub-machine-gun.",
  "The lobster’s calcified eye is used, in shoemaking, to fasten half-boots.",
  "In my childhood I was a fervent worshiper of the tiger: not the jaguar, the spotted tiger of the Amazonian tangles and the isles of vegetation that float down the Paraná, but that striped, Asiatic, royal tiger, that can be faced only by a man of war, on a castle atop an elephant.",
  "I used to linger endlessly before one of the cages at the zoo; I judged vast encyclopedias and books of natural history by the splendor of their tigers.",
  "I still remember those illustrations: I who cannot rightly recall the brow or the smile of a woman.",
  "Childhood passed away, and the tigers and my passion for them grew old, but still they are in my dreams.",
  "At that submerged or chaotic level they keep prevailing.",
  "And so, as I sleep, some dream beguiles me, and suddenly I know I am dreaming.",
  "Then I think: This is a dream, a pure diversion of my will; and now that I have unlimited power, I am going to cause a tiger.",
  "Never can my dreams engender the wild beast I long for.",
  "The tiger indeed appears, but stuffed or flimsy, or with impure variations of shape, or of an implausible size, or all too fleeting, or with a touch of the dog or the bird.",
  "As I went farther west, I saw nine-segmented insects with huge eyes like graters and latticework corselets like miners lamps, others with murmuring antennae; some with twenty-odd pairs of legs that looked more like staples; others of black lacquer and mother-of-pearl that crunched underfoot like shells; still others high legged like daddy longlegs with little pin-eyes as red as the eyes of albino mice, veritable glowing coals on stems with an expression of ineffable panic; still others with an ivory head— surprisingly bald, so that suddenly one had the most fraternal feelings for them—so close, their legs kicking forward like piston rods zigzagging in the air.",
  "Finally, there were transparent ones, bottles with hairy spots, perhaps: they came forward by the thousands—glassware, a display of light and sun so bright that afterward everything seemed ash and product of dark night.",
  "Kings do not touch doors.",
  "They know nothing of this pleasure: pushing before one gently or brusquely one of those large familiar panels, then turning back to replace it—holding a door in one’s arms.",
  "The pleasure of grabbing the midriff of one of these tall obstacles to a room by its porcelain node; that short clinch during which movement stops, the eye widens, and the whole body adjusts to its new surrounding.",
  "With a friendly hand one still holds on to it, before closing it decisively and shutting oneself in—which the click of the tight but well-oiled spring pleasantly confirms.",
  "He enjoyed prying, with the dignity of professional gestures, with relentless, expert hands, into the secret places of Proust or Rimbaud, then, exposing their so-called miracles, their mysteries, to the gaze of his very attentive audience, he would explain their case.",
  "With his sharp, mischievous little eyes, his ready-tied necktie and his square-trimmed beard, he looked enormously like the gentleman in the advertisements who, with one finger in the air, smilingly recommends Saponite, the best of soap powders, or the model Salamander: economy, security, comfort.",
  "There is nothing, he said, you see I went to look for myself, because I won’t be bluffed; nothing that I myself have not already studied clinically countless times, that I have not catalogued and explained.",
  "They should not upset you.",
  "Look, in my hands they are like trembling, nude little children, and I am holding them up to you in the hollow of my hand, as though I were their creator, their father, I have emptied them for you of their power and their mystery.",
  "I have tracked down, harried what was miraculous about them.",
  "Now they hardly differ from the intelligent, curious and amusing eccentrics who come and tell me their interminable stories, to get me to help them, appreciate them, and reassure them.",
  "You can no more be affected than my daughters are when they entertain their girl friends in their mother’s parlor, and chatter and laugh gaily without being concerned with what I am saying to my patients in the next room.",
  "This was what he taught at the Collège de France.",
  "And in the entire neighborhood, in all the nearby Faculties, in the literature, law, history and philosophy courses, at the Institute and at the Palais de Justice, in the buses, the métros, in all the government offices, sensible men, normal men, active men, worthy, wholesome, strong men, triumphed.",
  "Avoiding the shops filled with pretty things, the women trotting briskly along, the café waiters, the medical students, the traffic policemen, the clerks from notary offices, Rimbaud or Proust, having been torn from life, cast out from life and deprived of support, were probably wandering aimlessly through the streets, or dozing away, their heads resting on their chests, in some dusty public square.",
  "Like the waters of a sworn jury her eyes calmness was troubled yet her recovered sight finally prevailed and flew to the clear sky of her domed dream as does a fly from a sleeping child’s nose to the tumult of brilliant silence.",
  "Then the law-observers assembly decided to kill silence once and for all and erect on that very point the statue of her eyes calmness for the young woman was holding her recovered sight inside her hands like a miraculous snake.",
  "How came it about that Mrs. Paradise the dressmaker is here to dress me, and Mr. Babcock the bootmaker to boot me and a whole science of service to serve me, and that I am precisely here to be served?",
  "Do not speak to me of economics: that is merely a question of how we arrange matters between us.",
  "And do not speak to me of genesis: I am discussing the question of Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and the others as immediate causes of one another, I am not discussing creation.",
  "Personally, I do not believe in creation.",
  "Creation is stealing one thing to turn it into another.",
  "What I am discussing is existence, uncorrupted by art—how came it about, and so forth.",
  "Do not speak to me of love: Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and all the others do not like each other, in fact, we dislike each other because each of us is most certainly the cause of the other.",
  "I am the reason for Mrs. Paradise’s making frocks and Mrs. Paradise is the reason for my wearing frocks.",
  "If it were not for each other we should be occupied only with ourselves; we should not exist.",
  "How then came we to exist?",
  "I ask this question.",
  "Mrs. Paradise asks this question.",
  "I am Mrs. Paradise’s answer.",
  "Mrs. Paradise is my answer.",
  "As for Mr. Babcock, he has hair on his nose and I never look at him.",
  "As for all the others, I must put up a notice asking them to ring the bell gently.",
  "There is a woman in this city who loathes me.",
  "There are people everywhere who loathe me.",
  "I could name them; if they were in a book I could turn to the exact page.",
  "People who loathe me do so for one of two reasons: because I have frightened them because I have loathed them that is, made my death-face at them, which I shall not describe as it might in this way lose some of its virtue or because they are interested in me and there seems no practical way of or excuse for satisfying their interest.",
  "As to love, that is another matter—it has nothing to do with either interest or fear.",
  "Love is simply a matter of history, beginning like cancer from small incidents.",
  "There is nothing further to be said about it.",
  "But as to loathing: I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me.",
  "Further than this, I know what they mean, I sympathize with them, I understand them.",
  "There should be a name as poetic as love for this relationship between loather and loathed; it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest.",
  "To continue about this woman.",
  "What is to her irritation is to me myself.",
  "She has therefore a very direct sense of me, as I have a very direct sense of her, from being a kind of focus of her nervous system.",
  "There is no sentiment, no irony between us, nothing but feeling: it is an utterly serious relationship.",
  "For if one eat my meat, though it be known The meat was mine, the excrement is his own.",
  "I forget in what context these words were used by Donne—but they express very accurately how organic I feel this relationship to be.",
  "The tie between us is as positive as the tie between twins is negative.",
  "I think of her often.",
  "She is a painter—not a very good painter.",
  "I understand this too: it is difficult to explain, but quite clear to myself that one of the reasons I am attached to her is that she is not a good painter.",
  "Also her clothes, which do not fit her well: this again makes me even more attached to her.",
  "If she knew this she would be exasperated against me all the more, and I should like it; not because I want to annoy her but because this would make our relationship still more intense.",
  "It would be terrible to me if we ever became friends; like a divorce.",
  "I had him for a class in rhetoric, and he was short, chubby, with glasses like the ones Schubert wears in his portraits, walking through the cloisters in small slow strides, breviary in hand or with his hands resting in his cloak pockets, cap pushed well back on his large head with its thick gray hair.",
  "Nearly always quiet, or when paired with another professor speaking in measured tones, his voice strong and resonant, but most of the time alone in his cell, where he kept a few secular books mixed in with the religious ones, and from which I could see in springtime the green leaves and dark fruit of a mulberry tree climbing the wall and covering the gloomy little patio his window opened on.",
  "One day in class he tried to read us some verses, his voice aglow with heartfelt enthusiasm, and it must have been hard for him to understand the mockery, veiled at first, then open and hostile, of the students—because he admired poetry and its art, in a pedantic way, naturally.",
  "It was he who tried to get me to recite sometimes, although a shyness stronger than pleasure froze my delivery; he who encouraged me to write my first poems, critiquing them then and giving me as an esthetic precept what in my literary papers would always be a graceful hold on the material.",
  "He put me at the head of the class, a distinction for which I soon paid with a certain unpopularity among my schoolmates, and before final exams, as if understanding my diffidence and lack of confidence, he told me: Go to the chapel and pray.",
  "That will give you courage.",
  "Once I got to the university, in my self-absorption I stopped going to see him.",
  "One deep gold morning in fall, on my way to my early first class, I saw a poor little funeral turning the corner, the red brick wall of the school, which I’d forgotten; it was his.",
  "It was my heart, without hearing from anyone else, that told me so.",
  "He must have died alone.",
  "I don’t know how he held up through those last days of his life.",
  "Every flower is a Mona Lisa following our glance whenever we look at it.",
  "There is far north, yonder, far south, and here is the equator of words.",
  "The mouth is the kind of fruit that must be eaten skin and all.",
  "Kisses you have to peel go down hard.",
  "The emptied container of a sick man’s voice.",
  "Sudden strong feeling thins the lips.",
  "Petals become tissue-fine blown by the wind.",
  "Denial is born in the eyes.",
  "It begins to grow and then stops growing in the fixed expression of the mouth.",
  "For all final leave-takings and absolute goodbyes, sentimentality clamps its hold on the lips.",
  "The lips turn their back on us last of all.",
  "Nowadays habit has killed the joy in big dinners on New Year’s Eve: for many years the same elements have conspired to produce a happiness which has been enjoyed too often.",
  "Everyone knows in advance the precise mechanism of events.",
  "Family memories, felicitations and forecasts roll out like newspapers from presses.",
  "Old habits must be cast off to escape this monotony.",
  "There are a thousand ways to revitalize this occasion: here is one which we put to the test with the Futursimultaneists in Rome: Mattia, Belli, D’Avila, Pandolfo, Battistella, Vignazia, etc.",
  "At midnight after the endless chit-chat of waiting it is announced that dinner is served.",
  "In the dining room the tables have been removed and the guests are seated on chairs placed in a row, Indian file, one behind the other.",
  "The inevitable turkey arrives, served by the waiters on metal plates: the turkey is stuffed with mandarins and salami.",
  "Everyone eats in compulsory silence: the desire for noise and jollity is suppressed.",
  "Then suddenly a live turkey is let loose in the room, and it flounders about in terror, to the surprise of the men and the squeals of the women who can’t understand this resurrection of the food they’ve just eaten.",
  "Order is reestablished and everyone puts away his momentarily uncontained joy.",
  "Beaten by the silence, in an attempt to start any sort of conversation one of those present says: I haven’t yet expressed my good wishes for the New Year.",
  "Then as if following an order they all jump up and hurl themselves against the unwary conservator of tradition, whom they pummel repeatedly.",
  "Finally, happiness, exasperated by too much inaction, explodes and the guests disperse about the house, the most daring invading the kitchen.",
  "The cook and two waiters are removed by force and everyone sets to thinking up a way of varying the meal.",
  "A fierce competition between the hot ovens, while frying pans and saucepans pass from hand to hand amidst laughter, shouts and a rain of ingredients.",
  "Meanwhile others have discovered the wine cellar and thus an exceptional banquet is put together, which goes from kitchen to bedroom, from entrance hall to bathroom, to cellar.",
  "The dishes, put together almost by magic, follow one upon the other in the spirit of speed and harmony that animates the new cooks.",
  "A guest tells the owner of the house: Fifteen years ago, on this same date.",
  "But that same moment he is presented with a bowl full of spumante with cauliflowers, slices of lemon and roast beef floating in it: the memory of the past is shipwrecked in a stunning present.",
  "The youngest guests shout: Bury your memories.",
  "We must start the year in a quite different way from the pre-war banquets.",
  "Three gramophones function as tables and from on top of the records, which have become rotating plates, people pluck little sugar-coated candies, cylinders of Parmesan cheese and hard-boiled eggs, while three different rhythms of Japanese music accompany the dynamic service.",
  "The owner of the house suddenly turns out the lights.",
  "In the darkness the voice of one of the guests is heard: This year we will succeed in breaking through the envelope of the atmosphere and reach the planets.",
  "I invite you all to a banquet next New Year’s Eve on the moon, where we will finally taste foods of a flavour unknown to our palates and unimaginable drinks.",
  "At two o’clock on Nevsky Prospect, or rather on the Avenue of October 25th, nothing of note occurred.",
  "No, no, that man who stopped nearby the Coliseum was there purely by accident.",
  "Maybe his boot came untied, or maybe he wanted to light a cigarette.",
  "Or something else entirely.",
  "He’s just a visitor and doesn’t know where to go.",
  "But where are his things?",
  "Wait, he’s lifting his head for some reason, as if to look into the third floor, or even the fourth, maybe even the fifth.",
  "No, look, he simply sneezed and now he’s on his way again.",
  "He slouches a little and his shoulders are raised.",
  "His green overcoat flaps in the wind.",
  "Just now he turned onto Nadezhdenskaya and disappeared around the corner.",
  "A shoeshine man of eastern features stared after him and smoothed down his fluffy mustache with his hand.",
  "His overcoat was long and thick, of a purple hue, either plaid or maybe striped, or maybe, damn it all, polka-dot.",
  "Back in the thirties, in the midst of the Depression, I fled the city and moved to a Connecticut farm.",
  "It was the period of my first marriage.",
  "We lived in an old gambrel house, built about 1740, on top of a ridge called Wormwood Hill.",
  "I had bought the house, together with more than 100 acres of woodland and pasture, for $500 down.",
  "It had no electricity, no heat, no running water, and it was in bad repair, but it was a great, beautiful house.",
  "I spent most of three years, working with my hands, making it habitable.",
  "At that time early American art and furniture were practically being given away.",
  "Poor as we were, we managed to fill the house with priceless stuff.",
  "We were so far from the city and from all signs of progress that we might as well have been living in another age.",
  "One spring there appeared on the road, climbing up the hill, a man in a patchwork suit, with a battered silk hat on his head.",
  "His trousers and swallow-tail coat had been mended so many times, with varicolored swatches, that when he approached us, over the brow of the hill, he looked like a crazyquilt on stilts.",
  "He was an itinerant tinker, dried-out and old, thin as a scarecrow, with a high, cracked voice.",
  "He asked for pots and pans to repair, scissors and knives to sharpen.",
  "In the shade of the sugar maples, that a colonel in Washington’s army was said to have planted, he set up his shop and silently went to work on the articles I handed to him.",
  "When he was done, I offered him lunch in the kitchen.",
  "He would not sit down to eat, but accepted some food in a bag.",
  "I have been here before, he said to me quietly.",
  "On our way out, while we were standing in the front hall at the foot of the staircase, he suddenly cried, I hear the worms tumbling in this house.",
  "What do you mean?",
  "He did not answer, but cupped his hands over his eyes.",
  "I took it as a bad omen, a fateful prophecy, about my house, my marriage.",
  "And so it turned out to be.",
  "Some time later I learned that my visitor was a legendary figure, known throughout the countryside as the Old Darned Man.",
  "He had been a brilliant divinity student at Yale, engaged to a childhood sweetheart, with the wedding set for the day after graduation.",
  "But on that very day, while he waited at the church, the news was brought to him that she had run off with his dearest friend.",
  "Ever since then he had been wandering distractedly from village to village in his wedding clothes.",
  "As for the worms, they belonged to a forgotten page in local history.",
  "Late in the nineteenth century the housewives of the region, dreaming of a fortune to be made, had started a cottage industry in silkworm culture, importing the worms from China.",
  "The parlors of every farmhouse were lined with stacks of silkworm trays, in which the worms munched on mulberry leaves, making clicking and whispering noises.",
  "That was the sound heard in my hall.",
  "It’s a story without a happy ending.",
  "The worms died; the dreams of riches faded; abandoned plows rusted in the farmyards; one breathless summer day a black-funneled twister wheeled up Wormwood Hill from the stricken valley, dismantling my house, my barn, my grove of sugar maples; the face of my bride darkened and broke into a wild laughter; I never saw the Old Darned Man again.",
  "He was found lying on the ground.",
  "No one had missed him.",
  "No one was looking for him.",
  "An old woman found him.",
  "To put it vaguely.",
  "It happened so long ago.",
  "She was straying in search of wild flowers.",
  "With no eyes but for these she stumbled on him lying there.",
  "He lay face downward and arms outspread.",
  "He wore a greatcoat in spite of the time of year.",
  "Hidden by the body a long row of buttons fastened it all the way down.",
  "Buttons of all shapes and sizes.",
  "Worn upright the skirts swept the ground.",
  "That seems to hang together.",
  "Near the head a hat lay askew on the ground.",
  "At once on its brim and crown.",
  "He lay inconspicuous in the greenish coat.",
  "To catch an eye searching from afar there was only the white head.",
  "May she have seen him somewhere before?",
  "Somewhere on his feet before?",
  "Not too fast.",
  "She was all in black.",
  "The hem of her long black skirt trailed in the grass.",
  "It was close of day.",
  "Should she now move away into the east her shadow would go before.",
  "A long black shadow.",
  "It was lambing time.",
  "But there were no lambs.",
  "She could see none.",
  "Were a third party to chance that way theirs were the only bodies he would see.",
  "First that of the old woman standing.",
  "Then on drawing near it lying on the ground.",
  "That seems to hang together.",
  "The deserted fields.",
  "The old woman all in black stock-still.",
  "The body stockstill on the ground.",
  "Yellow at the end of the black arm.",
  "The white hair in the grass.",
  "The east foundering in night.",
  "Not too fast.",
  "Sky overcast all day till evening.",
  "In the west-north-west near the verge already the sun came out at last.",
  "A few drops if you will.",
  "A few drops in the morning if you will.",
  "In the present to conclude.",
  "It happened so long ago.",
  "Cooped indoors all day she comes out with the sun.",
  "She makes haste to gain the fields.",
  "Surprised to have seen no one on the way she strays feverishly in search of the wild flowers.",
  "Feverishly seeing the imminence of night.",
  "She remarks with surprise the absence of lambs in great numbers here at this time of year.",
  "She is wearing the black she took on when widowed young.",
  "It is to reflower the grave she strays in search of the flowers he had loved.",
  "But for the need of yellow at the end of the black arm there would be none.",
  "There are therefore only as few as possible.",
  "This is for her the third surprise since she came out.",
  "For they grow in plenty here at this time of year.",
  "Her old friend her shadow irks her.",
  "So much so that she turns to face the sun.",
  "Any flower wide of her course she reaches sidelong.",
  "She craves for sundown to end and to stray freely again in the long after-glow.",
  "Further to her distress the familiar rustle of her long black skirt in the grass.",
  "She moves with half-closed eyes as if drawn on into the glare.",
  "She may say to herself it is too much strangeness for a single March or April evening.",
  "No one abroad.",
  "Not a single lamb.",
  "Scarcely a flower.",
  "Shadow and rustle irksome.",
  "And to crown all the shock of her foot against a body.",
  "No one had missed him.",
  "No one was looking for him.",
  "Black and green of the garments touching now.",
  "Near the white head the yellow of the few plucked flowers.",
  "The old sunlit face.",
  "Tableau vivant if you will.",
  "In its way.",
  "All is silent from now on.",
  "For as long as she cannot move.",
  "The sun disappears at last and with it all shadow.",
  "All shadow here.",
  "Slow fade of afterglow.",
  "Night without moon or stars.",
  "All that seems to hang together.",
  "I’ve always felt like a nothing, having in my final resting place such a neighbor as van Gogh, who, I have been assured by several inhabitants of St. Rémy, was an impassioned painter, if a little unreliable.",
  "He would take long walks at night, disappearing among thick cypresses, which, however, could be easily approached by the swift stars.",
  "Or he would stir up a mistral with the cumbersome presence of his easel, his palette and his wild bundles of canvases.",
  "Thus saddled, he packed himself off to the vicinity of Montmajour, a ruin known for its perils.",
  "Arles and Les Baux, the country threading toward the Rhone, were also the settings for meanderings and sudden spurts of work by a vaguely suspicious artist, if you judged by his eyes and his red bristle without grasping the truth.",
  "It was only later that a smokescreen of explanations was hurled forth about him: This frequenter of the brothel of Arles was in fact a decent man, who was taken in a demented state to the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole just a few hundred yards from Glanum, then still a buried city, but hinted at by a cradle-shaped arc, which van Gogh had painted with the utmost skill in one of his works.",
  "I understood, in looking at his drawings, that he had up to that time worked, and only for us.",
  "And why not add to this story something which occurred in another space and time?",
  "This countryside, down to the belly of its grasshoppers, was fully communicated to us by a hand and a wrist.",
  "From what cauldron and from what paradise did Vincent van Gogh surge?",
  "From what great suffering did he produce those pebbles, those irises and those marshes, those narrow roads, those farms, that wheat, those vines, that river?",
  "In another century, locked behind the iron bars of several misfortunes, my own life tracked me down in a similar terrain.",
  "I realized this and tried to barter with Vincent’s profound vision, but while his eyes were enriched by their truth, their novel flowers, mine were wounded, not gladdened, by melting snow.",
  "A dog I loved no longer seemed to feel obliged to respond to my call; in the same way the earth hung back, hesitant about man’s approaching destiny.",
  "We’re no longer punctual in our meetings with nature.",
  "The world’s gears seem to turn according to a law different from our own.",
  "Perhaps our blood simply takes a little longer to circulate through the body.",

  "Now when in hell did I buy this diner and who needs it.",
  "At precisely three o’clock don Pedro would arrive at our table, greet each customer, mumble to himself some indecipherable sentences, and silently take a seat.",
  "He would order a cup of coffee, light a cigarette, listen to the chatter, sip his coffee, pay the waiter, take his hat, grab his case, say good afternoon, and leave.",
  "And so it was every day.",
  "What did don Pedro say upon sitting and rising, with serious face and hard eyes?",
  "He said: Don Pedro repeated the phrase many times each day.",
  "Upon rising, upon completing his morning preparations, upon entering and leaving his house—at eight o’clock, at one, at two-thirty, at seven-forty—in the café, in the office, before and after every meal, when going to bed each night.",
  "He repeated it between his teeth or in a loud voice, alone or with others.",
  "Sometimes with only his eyes.",
  "Always with all his soul.",
  "No one knew to whom he addressed these words.",
  "Everyone ignored the origin of his hate.",
  "When someone wanted to dig deeper into the story, don Pedro would turn his head with disdain and fall silent, modest.",
  "Perhaps it was a causeless hate, a pure hate.",
  "But the feeling nourished him, gave seriousness to his life, majesty to his years.",
  "Dressed in black, he seemed to be prematurely mourning for his victim.",
  "One afternoon don Pedro arrived graver than usual.",
  "He sat down heavily, and, in the center of the silence that was created by his presence, he simply dropped these words: Who and how?",
  "Some smiled, wanting to the take the thing as a joke.",
  "Don Pedro’s look stopped them.",
  "All of us felt uncomfortable.",
  "That sense of the void of death was certain.",
  "Slowly the group dispersed.",
  "Don Pedro remained alone, more serious than ever, a little withered, like a burnt-out star, but tranquil, without remorse.",
  "He did not return the next day.",
  "He never returned.",
  "Did he die?",
  "Maybe he needed that life-giving hate.",
  "Maybe he still lives and now hates another.",
  "I examine my actions, and advise you to do the same.",
  "Perhaps you too have incurred the same obstinate, patient anger of those small myopic eyes.",
  "Have you ever thought how many—perhaps very close to you—watch you with the same eyes as don Pedro?",
  "No one writes about this lake and it is spoken of only in whispers.",
  "As though to an enchanted castle, all roads to it are barred and over each one hangs a forbidding sign—a plain, blunt straight line.",
  "Man or beast, faced by that sign, must turn back.",
  "Some earthly power has put that sign there; past it none may ride, none may walk, crawl, or even fly.",
  "Guards with swords and pistols lurk beside the path in the nearby pine grove.",
  "You may circle and circle the silent wood searching for a way through to the lake, but you will find none and there will be no one to ask, for no one goes into this wood.",
  "They have all been frightened away.",
  "Your only chance to venture through will be one afternoon in the rain along a cattle track, in the wake of the dull clink of a cowbell.",
  "And from your first glimpse of it, vast and shimmering between the tree trunks, you know before you reach its banks that you will be in thrall to this place for the rest of your life.",
  "Segden Lake is as round as though traced out with a pair of compasses.",
  "If you were to shout from one side but you must not shout, or you will be heard, only a fading echo would reach the other bank.",
  "It is a long way across.",
  "Woods immure the lakeside entirely, a dense forest of row upon unbroken row of trees.",
  "As you come out of the wood to the water’s edge, you can see the whole of the forbidden shore: here a strip of yellow sand, there a grey stubble of reeds, there a lush swathe of grass.",
  "The water is smooth, calm, and unruffled, and apart from some patches of weed by the shore, the white lake bed gleams through the translucent water.",
  "A secret lake in a secret forest.",
  "The water looks up and the sky gazes down upon it.",
  "If there is a world beyond the forest, it is unknown, invisible; if it exists, it has no place here.",
  "Here is somewhere to settle forever, a place where a man could live in harmony with the elements and be inspired.",
  "But it cannot be.",
  "An evil prince, a squint-eyed villain, has claimed the lake for his own: there is his house, there is his bathing place.",
  "His evil brood goes fishing here, shoots duck from his boat.",
  "First a wisp of blue smoke above the lake, then a moment later the shot.",
  "Away beyond the woods, the people sweat and heave, whilst all the roads leading here are closed lest they intrude.",
  "Fish and game are bred for the villain’s pleasure.",
  "Here there are traces where someone lit a fire but it was put out and he was driven away.",
  "The next day the deportations about to begin, at night Rafael showed up, mantled in a vast hopelessness of black silk, with hood, his burning gazes were crossing on my forehead, torrents of wine began streaming on my cheeks, they scattered on the floor, men sipped it in their sleep. —Come, said Rafael, placing over my too shiny shoulders a hopelessness not unlike the one he was wearing.",
  "I was leaning towards mother, I was kissing her, incestuously, and then, out of the house.",
  "A huge swarm of large black butterflies, in from the tropics, thwarted my advance.",
  "Rafael dragged me after him and we descended in the direction of the railway tracks.",
  "Under foot I felt the tracks, heard the whistle of a locomotive, very near, my heart tightened.",
  "The train rattled over our heads.",
  "I opened my eyes.",
  "In front of me, across a huge expanse, stood a vast candelabra with thousands of arms.—Is it gold?.",
  "I whispered to Rafael. —Gold.",
  "You’ll crawl up one of the arms, so that, then, when I have lifted it up into the heavens, you’ll hook it up to the sky.",
  "Before the break of dawn, people will be able to save themselves, flying there.",
  "I’ll show them the way, and you’ll welcome them.",
  "I crawled up one of the arms, Rafael was shifting from one arm to the other, was touching them one after the other, the candelabra began to lift.",
  "A leaf fell on my forehead, on the very spot my friend had touched with his gaze, a maple leaf.",
  "I look all around: this cannot be the sky.",
  "Hours pass and I haven’t found anything.",
  "I know: down there the people gathered, Rafael touched them with his thin fingers, and they lifted off, and me, I’m still rising.",
  "This story could be called The Statues.",
  "Another possible title would be The Killing.",
  "Or even How to Kill Cockroaches.",
  "So I shall tell at least three stories, all of them true, because none of the three will contradict the others.",
  "Although they constitute one story, they could become a thousand and one, were I to be granted a thousand and one nights.",
  "The first story, How To Kill Cockroaches, begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches.",
  "A woman heard me complain.",
  "She gave me a recipe for killing them.",
  "I was to mix together equal quantities of sugar, flour and gypsum.",
  "The flour and sugar would attract the cockroaches, the gypsum would dry up their insides.",
  "I followed her advice.",
  "The cockroaches died.",
  "The next story is really the first, and it is called The Killing.",
  "It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches.",
  "A woman heard me complain.",
  "The recipe follows.",
  "And then the killing takes place.",
  "The truth is that I had only complained in abstract terms about the cockroaches, for they were not even mine: they belonged to the ground floor and climbed up the pipes in the building into our apartment.",
  "It was only when I prepared the mixture that they also became mine.",
  "On our behalf, therefore, I began to measure and weigh ingredients with greater concentration.",
  "A vague loathing had taken possession of me, a sense of outrage.",
  "By day, the cockroaches were invisible and no one would believe in the evil secret which eroded such a tranquil household.",
  "But if the cockroaches, like evil secrets, slept by day, there I was preparing their nightly poison.",
  "Meticulous, eager, I prepared the elixir of prolonged death.",
  "An angry fear and my own evil secret guided me.",
  "Now I coldly wanted one thing only: to kill every cockroach in existence.",
  "Cockroaches climb up the pipes while weary people sleep.",
  "And now the recipe was ready, looking so white.",
  "As if I were dealing with cockroaches as cunning as myself, I carefully spread the powder until it looked like part of the surface dust.",
  "From my bed, in the silence of the apartment, I imagined them climbing up one by one into the kitchen where darkness slept, a solitary towel alert on the clothes-line.",
  "I awoke hours later, startled at having overslept.",
  "It was beginning to grow light.",
  "I walked across the kitchen.",
  "There they lay on the floor of the scullery, huge and brittle.",
  "During the night I had killed them.",
  "On our behalf, it was beginning to grow light.",
  "On a nearby hill, a cockerel crowed.",
  "The third story which now begins is called The Statues.",
  "It begins by saying that I had been complaining about the cockroaches.",
  "Then the same woman appears on the scene.",
  "And so it goes on to the point where I awake as it is beginning to grow light, and I awake still feeling sleepy and I walk across the kitchen.",
  "Even more sleepy is the scullery floor with its tiled perspective.",
  "And in the shadows of dawn, there is a purplish hue which distances everything; at my feet, I perceive patches of light and shade, scores of rigid statues scattered everywhere.",
  "The cockroaches that have hardened from core to shell.",
  "Some are lying upside down.",
  "Others arrested in the midst of some movement that will never be completed.",
  "In the mouths of some of the cockroaches, there are traces of white powder.",
  "I am the first to observe the dawn breaking over Pompei.",
  "I know what this night has been, I know about the orgy in the dark.",
  "In some, the gypsum has hardened as slowly as in some organic process, and the cockroaches, with ever more tortuous movements, have greedily intensified the night’s pleasures, trying to escape from their insides.",
  "Until they turn to stone, in innocent terror and with such, but such an expression of pained reproach.",
  "Others— suddenly assailed by their own core, without even having perceived that their inner form was turning to stone. —these are suddenly crystallized, just like a word arrested on someone’s lips: I love.",
  "The cockroaches, invoking the name of love in vain, sang on a summer’s night.",
  "While the cockroach over there, the one with the brown antennae smeared with white, must have realized too late that it had become mummified precisely because it did not know how to use things with the gratuitous grace of the in vain: It is just that I looked too closely inside myself.",
  "It is just that I looked too closely inside.",
  ". . —from my frigid height as a human being, I watch the destruction of a world.",
  "Here and there, the parched antennae of dead cockroaches quiver in the breeze.",
  "The cockerel from the previous story crows.",
  "The fourth story opens a new era in the household.",
  "The story begins as usual: I was complaining about the cockroaches.",
  "It goes on up to the point when I see the statues in plaster of Paris.",
  "I look towards the pipes where this same night an infestation will reappear, swarming slowly upwards in Indian file.",
  "Should I renew the lethal sugar every night?",
  "Like someone who no longer sleeps without the avidity of some rite.",
  "And should I take myself somnambulant out to the terrace early each morning?",
  "In my craving to encounter the statues which my perspiring night has erected.",
  "I trembled with depraved pleasure at the vision of my double existence as a witch.",
  "I also trembled at the sight of that hardening gypsum, the depravity of existence which would shatter my internal form.",
  "The grim moment of choosing between two paths, which I thought would separate, convinced that any choice would mean sacrificing either myself or my soul.",
  "And today I secretly carry a plaque of virtue in my heart: This house has been disinfected.",
  "The fifth story is called Leibnitz and The Transcendence of Love in Polynesia.",
  "It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches.",
  "Somewhere on page 45 a comma is missing, omitted consciously or unconsciously by the typesetter who failed to include it on that day, at that time, on that machine; any imbalance this error may cause in the world is his responsibility.",
  "Except for the table of contents, which for unknown reasons comes last in Spanish, the book ends on this page, number 152, which does not mean it could not also begin again here in a backward motion as useless and irrational as the one undertaken by the reader to reach this point.",
  "This thoughtful and pointlessly melancholy man has been living for many years, by now, in the basement, because the house that rose above it has been destroyed or is uninhabitable.",
  "When the religious wars broke out, he had hoped it was a question—he was a foreigner in that country and practiced another religion—of the customary depravities to which that region’s inhabitants were inclined, all of them sanguineous of dying in some noisy and exhibitionistic way, and of killing others with particular cruelty.",
  "He bore no love for that country, where he lived as the secretary to the ambassador of another country, where wars of religion were not waged.",
  "His country fought atheistic wars, scientifically based.",
  "At the moment when the wars of religion had broken out, the secretary had been unable to return to his native land, where a ferocious scientific war was then underway: a war concerned, at least in origin, with hexagons and acids, but which bit by bit had then expanded to the inclusion of nearly all the disciplines, with the sole exclusion of ancient history.",
  "Now, the secretary, whom you see in sober dress, has been said, in generic terms, to practice another religion, but there is also the possibility that he practices none at all.",
  "What his country most respects is allegiance to ideals upon scientific bases; he himself, however, has no great love of science, and if he had to choose a field in which to specialize, ancient history would be his choice.",
  "But since this is the only non-controversial subject, choosing it would have been regarded as suspect, and derided as cowardly.",
  "He would have been put to death.",
  "Fortuitously, the outbreak of the religious war had allowed him to give no response to requests for clarification that had come from his homeland, but at the very same time he had definitively exiled himself in the country of religious wars.",
  "For years he had ventured no more than a few dozen yards from his cellar; he was probably the only foreigner left in a country where massacre was pandemic, and becoming pedantic; a country that no longer had cities, but picturesque expanses of ruins awaiting the death of the last combatant, so as then to grow ivy-covered and be transported into History.",
  "Though he had never admitted it in so many words, he liked to live in that territory precisely for its being the theater of a war that was alien to him.",
  "So History was none of his doing, but was something perceived as a rumble to which he had grown accustomed; as a lover of ancient history and dead languages, he too looked forward to living—as had always been his dream—in a country made only and entirely of ruins among grasses that have no history.",
  "This particular Bertha was a poor woman who did nothing but spin, being a skillful spinner.",
  "One day as she was going along she met Nero, the Roman emperor, to whom she said, May God grant you health so good you’ll live a thousand years.",
  "Nero, whom not a soul could abide because he was so mean, was astounded to hear someone wishing him a thousand years of life, and he replied, Why do you say that to me, my good woman?",
  "Because a bad one is always followed by one still worse.",
  "Nero then said, Very well, bring to my palace all you spin between now and tomorrow morning.",
  "At that, he left her.",
  "As she spun, Bertha said to herself, What will he do with the thread I’m spinning?",
  "I wouldn’t put it past him to hang me with it.",
  "That hangman is capable of everything.",
  "Next morning, right on time, here she was at Nero’s palace.",
  "He invited her in, received the thread she had spun, and said, Tie the end of the ball to the palace door and walk away as far as you can go with the thread.",
  "Then he called his chief steward and said, For the length of the thread, the land on both sides of the road belongs to this woman.",
  "Bertha thanked him and walked away very happy.",
  "From that day on she no longer needed to spin, for she had become a lady.",
  "When word of the event got around Rome, all the poor women went to Nero in hopes of a present such as he had given Bertha.",
  "But Nero replied, The good old times when Bertha spun are no more.",
  "Counting from the top: a chimney, antennae, a warped tin roof.",
  "Through a round window you see a girl trapped in threads whom the moon forgot to draw in and left to the mercy of gossipmongers and spiders.",
  "Farther down a woman reads a letter, cools her face with powder, and goes on reading.",
  "On the first floor a young man is walking back and forth thinking: how can I go outdoors with these bitten lips and shoes falling apart?",
  "The café downstairs is empty; it’s still morning.",
  "Just one couple in a corner.",
  "They are holding hands.",
  "He says: We will always be together.",
  "Waiter, a black coffee and a lemonade, please.",
  "The waiter goes behind the curtain and once there, bursts out laughing.",
  "Pale morning light, dying in shadows, loving the earth in midday rays, casting blue to skies in rings, sowing powder trails across balconies.",
  "Hung in evening to swing gently, on shoulders of time, growing old, yet swallowing events of a thousand nights of dying and loving, all blue.",
  "Gone to that tomb, hidden in cubic air, breathing sounds of sorrow.",
  "Crying love rising from the lips of wounded flowers, wailing, sobbing, breathing uneven sounds of sorrow, lying in wells of earth, throbbing, covered with desperate laughter, out of cool angels, spread over night.",
  "Dancing blue images, shades of blue pasts, all yesterdays, tomorrows, breaking on pebbled bodies, on sands of blue and coral, spent.",
  "Life lying heaped in mounds, with volcano mouth tops, puckered, open, sucking in atoms of air, sprinkling in atoms of air, coloring space, with flecks of brilliance, opaline glistening, in eyes, in flames.",
  "Blue flames burning, on rusty cliffs, overlooking blue seas, bluish.",
  "In sad times, hurt seabirds come to wail in ice white wind, alone, and wail in starlight wells, cold pits of evening, and endings, flinging rounds of flame sheeted balls of jagged bone, eaten, with remains of torn flowers, overwhelming after-thoughts, binding loves, classic pains, casting elongated shadows, of early blue.",
  "Stringing hours together in thin melodic lines, wrapped around the pearl neck of morning, beneath the laughter, of sad sea birds.",
  "I dreamed last night that Marcello told me it was too complicated.",
  "I had this dream last night.",
  "I wrote the libretto this past summer, in July.",
  "Everything is a dream, said his friend.",
  "What’s the difference if Marcello sets the libretto or not?",
  "None, he said.",
  "But you write a libretto and then let’s just see if you’d prefer to have it set or not.",
  "I’d like Marcello to set it, and Ronconi to direct it, and for there to be simultaneous performances outdoors above the Canal in Venice and at the Metropolitan Opera.",
  "That’s what I want.",
  "When I heard my wife’s voice on the telephone, calling me in Venice from New York City, I knew that someone must have died.",
  "We didn’t phone each other now about ordinary things.",
  "Arm in arm, sometimes.",
  "Occasionally, hand in hand.",
  "Her eyes look up.",
  "His look down.",
  "They look down together.",
  "The shine of plates.",
  "The smile of knives and of forks.",
  "Great big faces.",
  "Almost in the room.",
  "Stone they stare at them with their own face.",
  "And yet since it is Carnival he and she put on masks.",
  "One red mask his.",
  "One black mask hers.",
  "This is happiness.",
  "There is no other.",
  "Cold water faucet.",
  "A slight pain in the chest.",
  "To miss what massive.",
  "Man at the desk.",
  "Woman at the desk.",
  "Marchers off the street.",
  "No more eels.",
  "Isthmuses of islands.",
  "I have a reason.",
  "I have a reason to be sad.",
  "Here is a reason to be joyful.",
  "A grass turf.",
  "A striped day.",
  "But, most of all, this girl.",
  "It became what it began to be: a cemetery.",
  "An island dedicated to the dead.",
  "Black were the gondolas in the canals, and black the clothing that the gondoliers wore.",
  "Black were the buttons on the coat that he did not put on, to go out, because it was spring.",
  "Black were the steps on the stairway when he first came to them, blinded by the sun.",
  "And then his body went off.",
  "Again said Marcello, I said I won’t set it and I won’t.",
  "It’s too complicated.",
  "A librettist in writing should seek only to inspire the writing of music.",
  "You haven’t done that.",
  "I have more friends than you, Marcello, I said.",
  "Ah, but they don’t set libretti, Marcello said.",
  "But if I don’t set it, of course you are free to give it to someone else.",
  "Let me look at it one last time.",
  "At this point I woke up.",
  "The complicated dream was at an end.",
  "Actually, Morton had died, and I was walking around thinking, thinking, whether I wanted to or not.",
  "Thinking neither of Morton nor of the opera but of you.",
  "Walking north toward the point, I come on a dead seal.",
  "From a few feet away, he looks like a brown log.",
  "The body is on its back, dead only a few hours.",
  "I stand and look at him.",
  "There’s a quiver in the dead flesh: My God, he’s still alive.",
  "And a shock goes through me, as if a wall of my room had fallen away.",
  "His head is arched back, the small eyes closed; the whiskers sometimes rise and fall.",
  "He is dying.",
  "This is the oil.",
  "Here on its back is the oil that heats our houses so efficiently.",
  "Wind blows fine sand back toward the ocean.",
  "The flipper near me lies folded over the stomach, looking like an unfinished arm, lightly glazed with sand at the edges.",
  "The other flipper lies half underneath.",
  "And the seal’s skin looks like an old overcoat, scratched here and there—by sharp mussel shells maybe.",
  "I reach out and touch him.",
  "Suddenly he rears up, turns over.",
  "He gives three cries: Awaark.",
  "Awaark. —like the cries from Christmas toys.",
  "He lunges toward me; I am terrified and leap back, though I know there can be no teeth in that jaw.",
  "He starts flopping toward the sea.",
  "But he falls over, on his face.",
  "He does not want to go back to the sea.",
  "He looks up at the sky, and he looks like an old lady who has lost her hair.",
  "He puts his chin back down on the sand, rearranges his flippers, and waits for me to go.",
  "The next day I go back to say good-bye.",
  "He’s dead now.",
  "But he’s not.",
  "He’s a quarter mile farther up the shore.",
  "Today he is thinner, squatting on his stomach, head out.",
  "The ribs show much more: each vertebra on the back under the coat is visible, shiny.",
  "He breathes in and out.",
  "A wave comes in, touches his nose.",
  "He turns and looks at me—the eyes slanted; the crown of his head looks like a boy’s leather jacket bending over some bicycle bars.",
  "He is taking a long time to die.",
  "The whiskers white as porcupine quills, the forehead slopes.",
  ". Goodbye, brother, die in the sound of the waves.",
  "Forgive us if we have killed you.",
  "Long live your race, your inner-tube race, so uncomfortable on land, so comfortable in the ocean.",
  "Be comfortable in death then, when the sand will be out of your nostrils, and you can swim in long loops through the pure death, ducking under as assassinations break above you.",
  "You don’t want to be touched by me.",
  "I climb the cliff and go home the other way.",
  "Stendhal noticed at La Brède that there was no parquetry for the floor, that the fireplace, though baronial, was not dominated by a mirror, and that the right-hand jamb of it had been worn down by the slipper which Montesquieu placed there one hundred years before, to prop up the knee on which he chose to write Le Grandeur des Romains.",
  "A tall building in the fifteenth arrondissement faded away slowly and then completely vanished.",
  "Toward November the weather grew very bitter.",
  "No one knew why or even noticed.",
  "I forgot to tell you your hat looked perky.",
  "A new way of falling asleep has been discovered.",
  "Senior citizens snoop around to impose that sleep.",
  "You awake feeling refreshed but something has changed.",
  "Perhaps it’s the children singing too much.",
  "Sophie shouldn’t have taken them to the concert.",
  "I pleaded with her at the time, to no avail.",
  "Also, they have the run of the yard.",
  "Someone else might want to use it, or have it be empty.",
  "All the chairs were sat on in one night.",
  "And I was pale and restless.",
  "The actors walked with me to the cabins.",
  "I knew that someone was about to lose or destroy my life’s work, or invention.",
  "Yet something urged calm on me.",
  "There is an occasional friend left, yes.",
  "Married men, hand to mouth.",
  "I went down to the exhibition.",
  "We came back and listened to some records.",
  "Strange, I hadn’t noticed the lava pouring.",
  "But it’s there, she said, every night of the year, like a river.",
  "I guess I notice things less now than I used to, when I was young.",
  "And the arbitrariness of so much of it, like sheep’s wool from a carding comb.",
  "You can’t afford to be vigilant, she said.",
  "You must stay this way, always, open and vulnerable.",
  "Like a body cavity.",
  "Then if you are noticed it will be too late to file the architectural pants.",
  "We must, as you say, keep in touch.",
  "Not to be noticed.",
  "If it was for this I was born, I murmured under my breath.",
  "What have I been doing around here, all this month?",
  "Waiting for the repairman, I suppose.",
  "Where were you when the last droplets dribbled?",
  "Fastening my garter belt to my panty hose.",
  "The whole thing was over in less time than you could say Jack Robinson and we were back at base camp, one little thing after another gone wrong, yet on the whole life is spiritual.",
  "Still, it is time to pull up stakes.",
  "Probably we’ll meet a hooded stranger on the path who will point out a direction for us to take, and that will be okay too, interesting even if it’s boring.",
  "I remember the world of cherry blossoms looking up at the sun and wondering, what have I done to deserve this or anything else?",
  "The muscles which move the eyeballs, we are told, derive from a musculature which once occupied the body end to end.",
  "Sunblaze as day goes, and the light blots back the scene to iris the half-shut lashes.",
  "A look can no longer extricate the centre of the skyline copse.",
  "But the last greys, the departing glows caught by the creepers bearding its mass, prevail on the half-blinded retina.",
  "Branches deal with the air, vibrating the beams that thread into one’s eye.",
  "So that over there and in here compound a truce neither signed—a truce that, insensibly and categorically, grows to a decree, and what one hoped for and what one is, must measure themselves against those demands which the eye receives, delivering its writ on us through a musculature which occupies the body end to end.",
  "Old Bud Romick weighed three hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, and he weighed an ounce.",
  "He used to sit on his front porch swing, enraged and helpless, while his two tiny grandchildren, hilarious and hellish little boys, scampered just out of his reach and yelled hideously, Hell on you, Grandpa.",
  "His unbelievable Adam’s apple purpled and shone like the burl on the root of a white oak, and he sang his God Damns in despair.",
  "Old Bud Romick has fallen asleep as the twilight comes down Pearl Street in Martins Ferry, Ohio.",
  "The window shutters close here and there, and the flowing streetcars glow past into silence, their wicker seats empty, for the factory whistles have all blown down, and the widows all gone home.",
  "Empty, too, are the cinder alleys, smelling of warm summer asphalt.",
  "The streetlight columns, faintly golden, fill with the cracked mirrors of June bugs wings.",
  "Old Bud Romick sags still on the porch swing.",
  "The rusty chains do their best for his body in the dark.",
  "The dark turns around him, a stain like the bruise on a plum somebody somehow missed and left under a leaf.",
  "His two hellions have long since giggled their way upstairs.",
  "Old Bud Romick is talking lightly in his sleep, and an evening shower brings him a sticky new sycamore leaf in his sleep.",
  "Whether or not he is aware of leaves, I don’t know.",
  "I don’t know whether or not he is aware of anything touching his face.",
  "Whether or not he dreams of how slender sycamores are, how slender young women are when they walk beneath the trees without caring how green they are, how lucky a plum might be if it dies without being eaten, I don’t know.",
  "In the corner of a railway station he notices a young couple sleeping, their heads on their rucksacks, while the commuters hurry past and the taxis sound nearby.",
  "They appear to be students and he remembers his own youth: the hitch-hiking, the overnight buses, the post war cafés, his digs, the girls for whom he yearned, his incoherence, his shame, even the occasional moments of camaraderie or happiness, piercing him even yet by their intensity and brevity.",
  "Search though he may, he can find nothing durable for which he might have nostalgia, until it comes to him: their ability to sleep, curled up oblivious, while the world crashes forward about their ears.",
  "A man stands waving goodbye to his grandson as a train pulls out of a station, the same from which he left when he had come to visit his own grandfather at the same age, now a lifetime away.",
  "Indeed, he has no articulate memory of his grandfather who died shortly after, and certainly none of that last goodbye.",
  "This had always been a sorrow, that so poignant a moment should be gone for ever.",
  "But as he walks up into the town, he feels no loss at the realisation that his own grandson might scarcely remember, perhaps not at all, and so becomes aware of his grandfather in another way, more intense than any memory, more intense even than the image of that little boy waving to him through the still receding window.",
  "A woman has devoted her life to her family.",
  "One evening at the table as her husband talks of his day at work and the children of their friends at school, she picks up her half finished meal and turns it over on its face, carefully pressing it down onto the tablecloth.",
  "The children stare open mouthed.",
  "Her husband finally gasps, What are you doing?",
  "She smiles at him sadly, shaking her head.",
  "You understand nothing.",
  "It wasn’t me who did that.",
  "The woman who did that, by doing it, no longer exists.",
  "A fat man in a plaid suit walked west on 23rd Street, passing the quiet bar where Ritter sat, drink in hand.",
  "I saw him on the bus to work.",
  "This morning, the bartender said, her eyes intent.",
  "72nd Street, Central Park West.",
  "Ritter turned, looked out the window.",
  "The fat man wasn’t there.",
  "This morning, Ritter said, a guy in a gray suit and vest passed my building.",
  "This afternoon, he continued, in restaurant scent of garlic, ketchup, french fries and sizzling chops, I saw him again, walking west, on 20th Street.",
  "Fingertips on glass.",
  "In muted outside auto traffic, icy vodka.",
  "Well I’m the king of jazz now, thought Hokie Mokie to himself as he oiled the slide on his trombone.",
  "Hasn’t been a bone man been king of jazz for many years.",
  "But now that Spicy MacLammermoor, the old king, is dead, I guess I’m it.",
  "Maybe I better play a few notes out of this window here, to reassure myself.",
  "Said somebody standing on the sidewalk.",
  "Did you hear that?",
  "I did, said his companion.",
  "Can you distinguish our great homemade American jazz performers, each from the other?",
  "Used to could.",
  "Then who was that playing?",
  "Sounds like Hokie Mokie to me.",
  "Those few but perfectly selected notes have the real epiphanic glow.",
  "The real epiphanic glow, such as is obtained only by artists of the caliber of Hokie Mokie, who’s from Pass Christian, Mississippi.",
  "He’s the king of jazz, now that Spicy MacLammermoor is gone.",
  "Hokie Mokie put his trombone in its trombone case and went to a gig.",
  "At the gig everyone fell back before him, bowing.",
  "What we gonna play, Hokie?",
  "You the king of jazz now, you gotta decide.",
  "How bout Smoke’?",
  "Did you hear that?",
  "Hokie Mokie can just knock a fella out, just the way he pronounces a word.",
  "What a intonation on that boy.",
  "I don’t want to play Smoke, somebody said.",
  "Would you repeat that, stranger?",
  "I don’t want to play Smoke.",
  "Smoke is dull.",
  "I don’t like the changes.",
  "I refuse to play Smoke.",
  "He refuses to play Smoke’.",
  "But Hokie Mokie is the king of jazz and he says Smoke’.",
  "Man, you from outa town or something?",
  "What do you mean you refuse to play Smoke’?",
  "How’d you get on this gig anyhow?",
  "Who hired you?",
  "I am Hideo Yamaguchi, from Tokyo, Japan.",
  "Oh, you’re one of those Japanese cats, eh?",
  "Yes I’m the top trombone man in all of Japan.",
  "Well you’re welcome here until we hear you play.",
  "Tell me, is the Tennessee Tea Room still the top jazz place in Tokyo?",
  "No, the top jazz place in Tokyo is the Square Box now.",
  "OK, now we gonna play Smoke just like Hokie said.",
  "You ready, Hokie?",
  "OK, give you four for nothin’.",
  "The two men who had been standing under Hokie’s window had followed him into the club.",
  "Now they said: Good God.",
  "Yes, that’s Hokie’s famous English sunrise way of playing.",
  "Playing with lots of rays coming out of it, some red rays, some blue rays, some green rays, some green stemming from a violet center, some olive stemming from a tan center— That young Japanese fellow is pretty good, too.",
  "Yes, he is pretty good.",
  "And he holds his horn in a peculiar way.",
  "That’s frequently the mark of a superior player.",
  "Bent over like that with his head between his knees—good God, he’s sensational.",
  "He’s sensational, Hokie thought.",
  "Maybe I ought to kill him.",
  "But at that moment somebody came in the door pushing in front of him a four-and-one-half-octave marimba.",
  "Yes, it was Fat Man Jones, and he began to play even before he was fully in the door.",
  "You mean that sound that sounds like the cutting edge of life?",
  "That sounds like polar bears crossing Arctic ice pans?",
  "That sounds like a herd of musk ox in full flight?",
  "That sounds like male walruses diving to the bottom of the sea?",
  "That sounds like fumaroles smoking on the slopes of Mt.",
  "That sounds like the wild turkey walking through the deep, soft forest?",
  "That sounds like beavers chewing trees in an Appalachian marsh?",
  "That sounds like an oyster fungus growing on an aspen trunk?",
  "That sounds like a mule deer wandering a montane of the Sierra Nevada?",
  "That sounds like prairie dogs kissing?",
  "That sounds like witchgrass tumbling or a river meandering?",
  "That sounds like manatees munching seaweed at Cape Sable?",
  "That sounds like coatimundis moving in packs across the face of Arkansas?",
  "In Montreux, on Lake Geneva, we noticed a lady sitting on a park bench on the shore of the lake, who would, from time to time, on this same park bench, receive and then dismiss again the most diverse visitors, without moving a muscle.",
  "Twice a car stopped in front of her on the lake shore, and a young man in uniform got out, brought her the newspapers, and then drove off again; we thought it must be her private chauffeur.",
  "The lady was wrapped in several blankets, and we guessed her age to be well over seventy.",
  "Sometimes she would wave at a passerby.",
  "Probably, we thought, she is one of those rich and respectable Swiss ladies who live on Lake Geneva in the winter while their business is carried on in the rest of the world.",
  "The woman was, as we were soon informed, actually one of the richest and most respectable of the Swiss ladies who spend the winter on Lake Geneva; for twenty years she had been a paraplegic and had had her chauffeur drive her almost every day for those twenty years to the shore of Lake Geneva, had always had herself installed on the same bench, and had had the newspapers brought to her.",
  "For decades Montreux has owed fifty percent of its tax revenues to her.",
  "The famous hypnotist Fourati had hypnotized her twenty years ago and had been unable to bring her out of the hypnosis.",
  "In this way Fourati, as is well known, had ruined not only the lady’s life but his own as well.",
  "It was brought from the dead woman’s apartment.",
  "It stood empty a few days, empty until I filled it with books, all the bound ones, those bulky tomes.",
  "With that act I had let in the underworld.",
  "Something swelled up from below, mounted slowly, inexorably, like mercury in a gigantic thermometer.",
  "You were not allowed to turn your head away.",
  "The black volumes, their closed faces.",
  "They’re like the Algerians who stood at the Friedrichstrasse border crossing, waiting for the Volkspolizei to check their passports.",
  "My own passport lay a long time in various glass cubicles.",
  "And the fog all over Berlin that day, it is also in this bookcase.",
  "An old despair lives in there, it tastes of Passchendaele and the Treaty of Versailles—the taste, in fact, is older than that.",
  "The black heavy tomes—I come back to them—they are themselves a sort of passport, and they are so fat because they have accumulated so many stamps through the centuries.",
  "There is one trip, apparently, for which your baggage can’t be heavy enough, once you’ve embarked, when finally you.",
  "All the old historians are there, and are invited to climb up and look into our family.",
  "Nothing can be heard, but the lips move all the time behind the glass Passchendaele.",
  "One is reminded of a venerable government office—now follows a true ghost story—a grand building where portraits of longdead men hang behind glass, and one morning there appeared a blur on the inside of the glass.",
  "They had begun breathing during the night.",
  "The bookcase is even more powerful.",
  "Glares straight across the border zone.",
  "A shimmering membrane, the shimmering membrane of a dark river in which the room is forced to mirror itself.",
  "And you must not turn your head away.",
  "By hook or crook, by shoestring and bootstrap, by running and hiding, by mortice and tenon, by moving under cover of darkness, by wit and dumb luck, by spit and polish, by weights and measures, by love or money, by hurrying up and waiting, by word of mouth, by bread and board, by slice and dice, by not letting the left hand know, by bed and breakfast, by nuts and bolts, by nodding and smiling, by mortar and pestle, by hammer and tongs, by never crying over what we spill, by backing and filling, by surf and turf, by health and safety, by soup and sandwich, by bourbon and water, by offense and defense, by being as dumb as an ox is strong, by mind and body, by day for night, by sturm and drang, by fire and ice, by hit or miss—oh yes, by hit or miss.",
  "I’ve just left your house where you and rebecca served a dinner of peace to me and my sons.",
  "The ride home is not as long as the way i came, two centuries of hunger brought me along many detours before i recognized your house.",
  "It is raining and as i watch the raindrops spin like colored beads on the windshield, i hear your voice calling out to your ancestors to prepare a place for you, for you were returning home leaving the skeleton rites of twenty years behind.",
  "You and rebecca have been walking a long time.",
  "Your feet have crossed the african continent to this western one where you moved amid leaden eyes and laughter that froze you in snow/capped memories.",
  "Your journey began in 1957, when the ruling class could not understand your yawns of freedom, the motion of a million eyes to see for themselves what life was/is and could be, and you cut across the burial grounds of south africa where many of your comrades slept and you cut across those black africans smiling their long smiles from diplomatic teeth.",
  "Now you are returning home.",
  "Now your mother’s womb cries out to you.",
  "Now your history demands your heartbeat.",
  "And you turn your body toward the whirlwind of change, toward young black voices calling for a dignity speeding beyond control, on the right side of the road.",
  "But this nite full of whispering summer trees, this nite nodding with south african faces, heard you say, sonia.",
  "I must be buried in my country in my own homeland, my bones must replenish the black earth from whence they came, our bones must fertilize the ground on which we walk or we shall never walk as men and women in the 21st century.",
  "I talked to my sons as the car chased the longlegged rain running before us.",
  "I told them that men and women are measured by their acts not by their swaggering speech or walk, or the money they have stashed between their legs.",
  "I talked to my sons about bravery outside of bruce lee grunts and jabs, outside of star wars knights fertilizing america’s green youth into continued fantasies while reality explodes underground in neutron boldness.",
  "I said you have just sat and eaten amid bravery.",
  "Relish the taste.",
  "Stir it around and around in your mouth until the quick sweetness of it becomes bitter, then swallow it slowly, letting this new astringent taste burn the throat.",
  "Bravery is no easy taste to swallow.",
  "I said this man and woman we have just left this nite have decided to walk like panthers in their country, to breathe again their own breath suspended by twenty years of exile, to settle in the maternal space of their birth where there are men who shake hands without hearts waiting for them.",
  "They are a fixed portrait of courage.",
  "It is 2 A.M., my children stretch themselves in dreams, kicking away the room’s shadows.",
  "I stare at the night piling in little heaps near my bed.",
  "Maybe you are a madman.",
  "I a mad woman to want to walk across the sea, to saddle time while singing a future note.",
  "We follow the new day’s breath, we answer old bruises waiting to descend upon our heads, we answer screams creeping out of holes and shells buried by memories waiting to be cleansed.",
  "You invoking the ghosts lurking inside this child/woman.",
  "You breaking my curtain of silence.",
  "I love the tom-tom days you are marching, your feet rooted in the sea.",
  "Save a space for me and mine zeke and rebecca.",
  "This lost woman, who walks her own shadow for peace.",
  "It had been a long day at work and a long ride back to the small apartment where I lived.",
  "When I got there I flicked on the light and saw on the table an envelope with my name on it.",
  "Where was the clock?",
  "Where was the calendar?",
  "The handwriting was my father’s, but he had been dead for forty years.",
  "As one might, I began to think that maybe, just maybe, he was alive, living a secret life somewhere nearby.",
  "How else to explain the envelope?",
  "To steady myself, I sat down, opened it, and pulled out the letter.",
  "Dear Son was the way it began.",
  "Dear Son and then nothing.",
  "The tyrant Phalaris locked his prisoners inside a magnificently wrought brazen bull and tortured them over a slow fire.",
  "So that nothing unseemly might spoil his feasting, he commanded the royal artisans to design the bull in such a way that its smoke rose in spicy clouds of incense.",
  "When the screams of the dying reached the tyrant’s ears, they had the sound of sweet music.",
  "And when the bull was reopened, the victims bones shone like jewels and were made into bracelets.",
  "Do you not sometimes wish that certain people might die, do you not long for the deaths of prime ministers or dictators, do you not envision presidents dying of heart attacks, generals shooting themselves while cleaning their rifles, skinflint landlords pushed into wells by rebellious peasants, industrialists skidding on newly waxed floors and sailing through penthouse windows, War Department scientists exposed to radiation while goosing cute researchers in the lab, demagogues exploding with the leaky gas main, your mother-in-law scalded by a pot of boiling chicken soup— do you not wish any or all of these were dead?",
  "If the death of one man could bring bliss to the world, would you order that one death?",
  "If the deaths of two men could do it, would you order those two deaths?",
  "Or five deaths?",
  "Or a hundred?",
  "Or twenty million?",
  "How many deaths would you order to bring bliss to the world?",
  "If it required only one man’s death, after all, to bring bliss to the world and you sanctioned such a death, how would you feel should you learn that that one man was to be you?",
  "Do you think that the most monstrous thing about the story of Phalaris is not that a tyrant put prisoners to death—since that has happened throughout history—but the particularly gruesome way he went about it?",
  "Yet do you never catch yourself wishing that once, only once, once only but definitely once, you could sit beside the tyrant just to satisfy your curiosity about what the bull looked like, what the music sounded like?",
  "Would you consider Phalaris and his artisans more, or less, reprehensible if the screams of the dying had reached the ear undisguised?",
  "If you were one of the victims, would it make any difference to you?",
  "Which do you consider the more truly good man: the victim who wishes his screams to be heard as screams, or he who wishes them to be heard as music?",
  "Do you think your answer is relevant to the problem of why at executions we praise the victim who meets his death with stoic calm and witty epigrams, rather than he who must be dragged to the scaffold pissing in his pants?",
  "In your opinion, is it or is it not a good thing that we do so?",
  "Learning at this point in the examination that the first victim of the bull was the chief artisan who designed it, do you a believe that the artisan deserved his fate? , and b feel vaguely uncomfortable about your own occupation, job, profession, or calling?",
  "Why or why not?",
  "Based upon your interpretation of the story of Phalaris and the bull, do you view yourself in the light of your present situation in life as metaphorically equivalent to tyrant, artisan, victim, or wearer of bone jewelry?",
  "Whenever we turn on a faucet, the celebrated tube of water appears.",
  "We say tube because it appears not to be moving, it appears as likely to have been produced from the porcelain upwards as from the spigot downwards, as is the usual case.",
  "As for me, whenever I turn on any faucet, I satisfy my curiosity regarding its nature and character by simply telling myself that a column is coming.",
  "This is why a person in a bathroom with both sink faucets running and the bathtub faucets dripping may be reminded of standing on a plantation veranda; and why it may be enough to walk through the laundryroom in the basement to experience a feeling reminiscent of standing among the ruins of Greek Temple architecture.",
  "A man had just married an automobile.",
  "But I mean to say, said his father, that the automobile is not a person because it is something different.",
  "For instance, compare it to your mother.",
  "Do you see how it is different from your mother?",
  "Somehow it seems wider, doesn’t it?",
  "And besides, your mother wears her hair differently.",
  "You ought to try to find something in the world that looks like mother.",
  "I have mother, isn’t that enough of a thing that looks like mother?",
  "Do I have to gather more mothers?",
  "They are all old ladies who do not in the least excite any wish to procreate, said the son.",
  "But you cannot procreate with an automobile, said father.",
  "The son shows father an ignition key.",
  "See, here is a special penis which does with the automobile as the man with the woman; and the automobile gives birth to a place far from this place, dropping its puppy miles as it goes.",
  "Does that make me a grandfather?",
  "Said the father.",
  "That makes you where you are when I am far away, said the son.",
  "Father and mother watch an automobile with a just married sign on it growing smaller in a road.",
  "I am seldom in this city.",
  "I am here by chance.",
  "I have an acquaintance in this city.",
  "She is a good friend.",
  "We carry on an intimate and extensive correspondence with one another.",
  "I am here by chance.",
  "I don’t want to run into my friend.",
  "I am stopping only for a day.",
  "I don’t have any time.",
  "If I see her I’ll have to devote myself to her.",
  "She always takes possession of me.",
  "She says, what are you doing here, or what are you doing here, or what are you doing here.",
  "I say, nothing at all.",
  "She pulls me.",
  "She drags me along with her.",
  "She says, and you didn’t even give me a call.",
  "I say, I was just about to.",
  "She says, then it’s perfectly splendid that we’ve run into each other.",
  "I say, yes.",
  "I ask, aren’t you on your way to work.",
  "She says, nonsense, today’s my housecleaning day.",
  "I say, then you probably have a lot of laundry.",
  "She says, I wouldn’t think of washing now that you are here.",
  "I say, is there a movie around here.",
  "She says, movie.",
  "First a cafe.",
  "She takes my arm.",
  "She says, when did you get here.",
  "I say, last evening.",
  "She says that isn’t possible.",
  "And where did you sleep?",
  "I say, in a hotel.",
  "She says, come, come.",
  "We’ll pack up your luggage immediately and take it to my house.",
  "I say, that won’t be worth the trouble, I am continuing my trip this afternoon.",
  "She says, you are continuing your trip this afternoon, you can’t do that to me.",
  "I say, don’t be angry, I hardly have time.",
  "She says, well what are you up to.",
  "I say, nothing special.",
  "She says, incidentally how did the story turn out.",
  "I say, what story.",
  "She says, the story in your next to last letter.",
  "I say, in my next to last letter.",
  "She says, his name was Roland or Ronald.",
  "You know what I mean.",
  "I say, oh that one.",
  "She says, what do you mean that one.",
  "You wrote pages about him and that you didn’t know up from down.",
  "I say, he’s gone.",
  "She says, gone just like that.",
  "That is fantastic.",
  "I say, yes.",
  "Isn’t there a movie here?",
  "We go up Kaiserallee.",
  "We sit down in a coffee shop and smoke.",
  "She says, why do you keep talking about a movie.",
  "We haven’t had a real good talk yet.",
  "I say, no.",
  "She says, have you already had breakfast?",
  "I say, no.",
  "She says, I’ll get us something to eat.",
  "I say, I am not hungry.",
  "She says, but you must eat a good meal, do you want a sandwich or cake.",
  "I say, nothing.",
  "She goes to the buffet.",
  "She takes two trays.",
  "She speaks with the help.",
  "I leave the coffee shop through the Königstrasse exit.",
  "Weekend nights my brother and his friends used to hang out at the corner candy store near the top of the stairs at Fort Washington Avenue and 187th Street.",
  "They wore leather jackets and smoked cigars, or at least pretended to, as they flirted with girls and made smart remarks.",
  "My brother boasted to me that he’d seen Xavier Cugat, the band leader, at the candy store many times.",
  "Cugat was courting Frances Lassman, later known as Abby Lane, who was in my brother’s eighth grade class at P.S.",
  "She was beautiful and wasn’t allowed to go out with any of the boys in the neighborhood.",
  "According to my brother she was destined for more important things in life—a musical career and marriage to someone successful.",
  "Xavier Cugat was then in his thirties, at the height of his fame, and we all knew him from the movies and from photos in newspapers in which he stood in front of his orchestra, his Chihuahua cradled in one hand as he conducted with the other.",
  "Or else he’d be alone in the picture, smiling, his pencil-thin mustache curling upwards as he puffed a cigar.",
  "Cugat often stopped at the corner to buy himself a cigar.",
  "He’d pull up in his black Cadillac, walk briskly into the candy store, and nod to the boys on his way out.",
  "Then he’d drive up the hill to Cabrini Boulevard to the six-story apartment house where his future wife Frances lived.",
  "A huge cement truck turns the corner, and you get the full impact of its sensuality.",
  "Those ruts on the road and in the lawn.",
  "Even at night the cement plant has a strange energy, drawing adolescents to stare through its fences, causing the watchman to shine his light nervously among the parked and sleeping mixers.",
  "Still, from those fluid beginnings and slow revolutions, the cement itself forms the pale and stony squares of sidewalk.",
  "Roller skates, hopscotch, salted ice.",
  "Then the slow cracking from the tree roots below and we are back to sensuality again.",
  "Cranes are not to be compared with trees, not with their almost Scandinavian sense of the importance of power and duty.",
  "Sometimes the face is very far from the heart, and the one thing you would like to do—lie down next to that beautiful passing stranger, for instance—is the thing that seems least possible.",
  "So you sway against the gray sky, pretending to a stiffness you do not feel.",
  "The building you helped create rises toward you, filled with the sounds of hammering and the strange shine of work lights.",
  "To take some tutoring from pumps, I said.",
  "I was thinking about the windmill, that swaying, clanking lecturer.",
  "Slow cows come to drink from the tank.",
  "We filled it didn’t we, harvesting water from weather, not by bringing it down from the sky like rain, but up from the earth like oil.",
  "Now, roll up your blue sleeve and plunge your arm into that tank.",
  "If you clench and unclench your fist regularly you can learn something about the submersible pump, beating down there where weather is a dream.",
  "We have strong feelings about bulldozers, their buzzing and scraping, their clumsy abruptness, their way of tipping saplings into piles of burnable roots and brush.",
  "Our faces get vinegary when we think of it.",
  "But the bulldozer’s point of view is remarkably different.",
  "The bulldozer thinks of itself as a lover.",
  "It considers that its loved one, from whom it is always separated, is wrapped in many short, soft, buttery strips of leather.",
  "It imagines itself removing these worn leather wrappings, one at a time and with great tenderness, to get at the body of the loved one.",
  "Perverse, you will say.",
  "But see, you have already entered the life of the bulldozer: your hands reach for the next piece of leather.",
  "Shrubs and young trees go under.",
  "The son of a chemist was studying abroad.",
  "On his father’s death, he returned home to look after the dispensary, becoming the chemist of a small village on the outskirts of Viadana in the province of Mantua.",
  "Word of his learning had spread in the country areas, fed by rumours about his huge library, about his prodigious cure for ear-ache, his ultra-modern method for irrigating the fields, and his fluency in twelve languages, not to mention rumours that he was translating the Divine Comedy into German.",
  "The owner of a cheese-making factory in the area decided to pay a stipend to the scholar, who was by now middle-aged, in return for which he would help his daughter with her grammar school education.",
  "The girl, a sporting type, was not doing too well at school and, furthermore, she hated books, Latin, and good Italian prose.",
  "The chemist accepted—more from love of learning than for any financial motive—and every day for a whole summer he went to give lessons to the young athlete.",
  "And one day it happened that the young athlete fell in love with him—so much so that she dropped all sport in favour of writing poetry, Latin verse and, of course, long letters.",
  "There are still people who talk of the car the chemist bought to mark the occasion, the couple’s long country trips, and even of nocturnal liaisons in a barn.",
  "At any rate, evidence of their late-summer affair only came to light the following winter when a bundle of letters was confiscated by the nuns at the girl’s convent school, and duly handed over to her parents.",
  "The contents of these letters seemed so disgusting in the eyes of the owner of the cheese-making factory that he decided to ruin the chemist, and drive him from the village forever.",
  "The girl’s brothers, who were active fascists at the time, ransacked his shop on the village square a number of times, and on one occasion gave its owner a savage beating.",
  "However, all this does not seem to have unduly worried the chemist.",
  "For a while, he continued to receive customers in the ransacked pharmacy, surrounded by broken window panes, torn down shelves and smashed jars.",
  "Then, one fine day, he shut up shop and withdrew among his books, rarely venturing out.",
  "All the village knew him to be deep in his studies, and every now and again they saw him smiling as he crossed the square and headed for the post office to pick up new books that had arrived for him.",
  "Some time later, he was taken to hospital and then to a sanatorium.",
  "He remained for a number of years in the sanatorium, and no one heard any more about him.",
  "On his return from the sanatorium, the ageing scholar was extremely thin.",
  "An old housemaid, who had gone back to taking care of him, complained to everyone that he never wanted to eat: he said he didn’t care to eat, and spent the whole day immersed in his books.",
  "Thinner by the day, the man seldom went out and evidently no longer recognized anyone in the village, including the daughter of the now deceased owner of the cheese-making factory who he occasionally met in the square.",
  "Yet he smiled at all and sundry, and it is said he used to greet dogs by raising his hat.",
  "Apparently, he had given up eating altogether after his old housemaid died and persisted in fasting for weeks on end, so that when he was found dead in his library by a plumber he was a skeleton in all but name: all that remained of him was wrinkled skin clinging to bones.",
  "He was bent over the last page of a book onto which he was sticking a strip of paper.",
  "Years later, his large library was inherited by a niece.",
  "The niece, rummaging through the books, believed she had worked out how the old scholar had spent the last part of his life.",
  "For this man, every story, novel, or epic poem had to end happily.",
  "He obviously couldn’t bear tragic endings, nor for a story to end on a sad or melancholic note.",
  "So, over the years, he devoted himself to re-writing the endings of some hundred or so books in every conceivable language.",
  "By inserting small sheets or strips of paper over passages that had to be re-written, he utterly changed the outcome of the stories, bringing them unfailingly to a happy ending.",
  "Many of the last days of his life must have been dedicated to re-writing the eighth chapter of the third part of Madame Bovary, which is where Emma dies.",
  "In the new version, Emma recovers and is reunited with her husband.",
  "His very last piece of work, however, consisted of the strip of paper he had in his fingers and which, on the point of dying of starvation, he was sticking onto the last line of a French translation of a Russian novel.",
  "This was possibly his masterpiece; by changing just three words, he transformed a tragedy into a satisfactory resolution of life’s problems.",
  "Get up earlier, today.",
  "Don’t lie motionless in an attempt to recapture fleeting images; let dreams trickle away, jump out of bed.",
  "From the terrace: watch the Sunrise—with dry eyes, without thinking of the millions, billions of years throughout which this poignant light, and so on and so forth.",
  "Nothing of the kind.",
  "A bath, soon afterward.",
  "Breakfast: orange juice, toast, eggs.",
  "Eat with appetite, chew vigorously and swiftly; don’t ruminate, don’t mix food with bitter thoughts.",
  "Very strong, with sugar today, just today, never again from now on, avoid expressions such as never again.",
  "Finish off the meal with a glass of ice-cold water, sipping it slowly.",
  "Pay special attention to the ice cubes tinkling against the glass.",
  "Wake up the wife.",
  "And why not?",
  "She’s been the companion of so many years.",
  "Make love, yes, a quick act of love, but with the utmost tenderness.",
  "Let her go back to sleep afterward.",
  "Let her roam through the country of dreams as much as she wants; let her say farewell to her monsters, to her demons, to her fairies, to her princesses, to her godparents.",
  "Brisk, fierce movements.",
  "Afterward, feel the arms tingling, the head throbbing, splitting, almost: life.",
  "Take the car out of the garage.",
  "Take advantage of the time spent driving to do some thinking.",
  "Try to clarify certain doubts once and for all; maybe stop off at the rabbi’s place.",
  "Maybe talk to a priest as well.",
  "Maybe bring priest and rabbi together?",
  "At the office.",
  "Render decisions on the latest documents.",
  "Tidy up the desk.",
  "Clean out the drawers, throw away gewgaws.",
  "Set pen to paper.",
  "Write a letter, a poem, anything.",
  "Salad, cold cuts.",
  "Gab away, talk drivel.",
  "Observe the faces.",
  "Memorize the details of the faces.",
  "Hug the friends.",
  "Hug them deeply touched.",
  "No tears at all.",
  "Phone Dr. Francisco.",
  "Ask if there’s anything that can be done quite unlikely; but say no to tranquilizers.",
  "Get the family together, including the baby of the family.",
  "Mention they’ll be taken for a drive, and get the station wagon out of the garage.",
  "Head for the outskirts of the city.",
  "Find a spot on an elevation with a panoramic view.",
  "Have everybody get out of the car.",
  "In a low, quiet voice, explain what is about to happen: the earth, which will open up explain: as if it were parched, the bones, which will appear—the bones only, white, clean—bones that will then be covered with flesh, with hair, with eyes, with finger and toenails: men, women, laughing, crying.",
  "Everybody knows the story about me and Dr. Freud, says my grandfather.",
  "We were in love with the same pair of black shoes in the window of the same shoe store.",
  "The store, unfortunately, was always closed.",
  "There’d be a sign: DEATH IN THE FAMILY or BACK AFTER LUNCH, but no matter how long I waited, no one would come to open.",
  "Once I caught Dr. Freud there shamelessly admiring the shoes.",
  "We glared at each other before going our separate ways, never to meet again.",
  "It was the epoch of the masters of levitation.",
  "Some evenings we saw solitary men and women floating above the dark tree tops.",
  "Could they have been sleeping or thinking?",
  "They made no attempt to navigate.",
  "The wind nudged them ever so slightly.",
  "We were afraid to speak, to breathe.",
  "Even the nightbirds were quiet.",
  "Later, we’d mention the little book clasped in the hands of the young woman, and the way that old man lost his hat to the cypresses.",
  "In the morning there were not even clouds in the sky.",
  "We saw a few crows preen themselves at the edge of the road; the shirts raise their empty sleeves on the blind woman’s clothesline.",
  "My guardian angel is afraid of the dark.",
  "He pretends he’s not, sends me ahead, tells me he’ll be along in a moment.",
  "Pretty soon I can’t see a thing.",
  "This must be the darkest corner of heaven, someone whispers behind my back.",
  "It turns out her guardian angel is missing too.",
  "It’s an outrage, I tell her.",
  "The dirty little cowards leaving us all alone, she whispers.",
  "And of course, for all we know, I might be a hundred years old already, and she just a sleepy little girl with glasses.",
  "I knew a woman who collected black buttons she found in the street.",
  "Some years there’d be only one or two.",
  "When I asked her what for and why only black buttons, she shrugged her shoulders.",
  "She kept them in a jar on the coffee table.",
  "They seduced the eye.",
  "One button even had some thread left as if it had been torn in a hurry.",
  "A violent scene took place, a burst of passion on some dark doorway, and then she came along the next day and found the button.",
  "A narrow street with windows weakly lit at dinner time and self-absorbed men and women standing around and an occasional child who eats alone looking at nothing.",
  "My aspiration is to create a kind of nongenre made up of fiction, autobiography, the essay, poetry, and of course, the joke.",
  "A scene from French movies of the fifties that I still love: A fly gets shut in a room with three armed thugs and a woman, gagged and bound, who watches them with eyes popping.",
  "In front of each man on the table there is a sugar cube and a pile of large bills.",
  "No one stirs.",
  "A naked bulb hangs from the ceiling by a long wire so they can see the fly count its legs.",
  "It counts them on the table, tantalizingly close to a sugar cube, and then it counts them at the end of someone’s nose.",
  "I have no idea if this is the way it really was in the movie.",
  "I’ve worked on the scene over the years, making little adjustments in it as one does with a poem.",
  "Descartes, I hear, did his best philosophizing by lazing in bed past noon.",
  "I’m on the way to the dump, tooting my horn and waving to the neighbors.",
  "An invasion of beggars, but there’s one consolation: no one lacks shoes, there are more than enough shoes to go around.",
  "Sometimes, it’s true, a shoe has to be taken off some severed leg found in the underbrush, and it’s of no use except to somebody with only one good leg.",
  "But this doesn’t happen very often, usually corpses are found with both shoes intact.",
  "Their clothing on the other hand isn’t usable.",
  "Ordinarily it has bullet holes, bloodstains, or is torn apart, or an electric cattle prod has left burns that are ugly and difficult to hide.",
  "So we don’t count on the clothes, but the shoes are like new.",
  "Generally they’re good, they haven’t had much wear because their owners haven’t been allowed to get very far in life.",
  "They poke out their heads, they start thinking thinking doesn’t wear out shoes, and after just a few steps their career is cut off.",
  "That is to say, we find shoes, and since they’re not always the size we need, we’ve set up a little exchange post in a vacant lot downtown.",
  "We charge only a few pesos for the service: you can’t ask much from a beggar, but even so it does help to pay for maté and some biscuits.",
  "We earn real money only when we manage to have a real sale.",
  "Sometimes the families of the dead people, who’ve heard of us heaven knows how, ask us to sell them the dead man’s shoes if we have them.",
  "The shoes are the only thing that they can bury, poor things, because naturally the authorities would never let them have the body.",
  "It’s too bad that a good pair of shoes drops out of circulation, but we have to live and we can’t refuse to work for a good cause.",
  "Ours is a true apostolate and that’s what the police think, too, so they never bother us as we search about in vacant lots, sewer conduits, fallow fields, thickets, and other nooks and crannies where a corpse may be hidden.",
  "The police are well aware that, thanks to us, this city can boast of being the one with the bestshod beggars in the world.",
  "The eye is the organ of vision, and the third eye is no exception to that.",
  "Open it and it sees, close it and it doesn’t.",
  "Most people have a third eye but they don’t trust it.",
  "That wasn’t really F., standing on the corner, hands in his overcoat pockets, waiting for the light to change: F.",
  "Died two months ago.",
  "It’s a trick my eyes played on me, they say.",
  "A trick of the light.",
  "I’ve got nothing against telepathy, said Jane; but the telephone is so much more dependable.",
  "What’s the difference between vision and a vision?",
  "The former relates to something it’s assumed you’ve seen, the latter to something it’s assumed you haven’t.",
  "Language is not always dependable either.",
  "If you want to use the third eye you must close the other two.",
  "Then breathe evenly; then wait.",
  "This sometimes works; on the other hand, sometimes you merely go to sleep.",
  "That sometimes works also.",
  "When you’ve had enough practice you don’t have to bother with these preliminary steps.",
  "You find too that what you see depends partly on what you want to look at and partly on how.",
  "As I said, the third eye is only an eye.",
  "There are some who resent the third eye.",
  "They would have it removed, if they could.",
  "They feel it as a parasite, squatting in the centre of the forehead, feeding on the brain.",
  "To them the third eye shows only the worst scenery: the gassed and scorched corpses at the cave-mouth, the gutted babies, the spoor left by generals, and, closer to home, the hearts gone bubonic with jealousy and greed, glinting through the vests and sweaters of anyone at all.",
  "Torment, they say and see.",
  "The third eye can be merciless, especially when wounded.",
  "But someone has to see these things.",
  "Try not to resist the third eye: it knows what it’s doing.",
  "Leave it alone and it will show you that this truth is not the only truth.",
  "One day you will wake up and everything, the stones by the driveway, the brick houses, each brick, each leaf of each tree, your own body, will be glowing from within, lit up, so bright you can hardly look.",
  "You will reach out in any direction and you will touch the light itself.",
  "After that there are no more instructions because there is no more choice.",
  "Light was calloused in the leaded panes of the college chapel and shafted into the terrazzo rink of the sanctuary.",
  "The duty priest tested his diction against pillar and plaster, we tested our elbows on the hard bevel of the benches or split the gold-barred thickness of our missals.",
  "I could make a book of hours of those six years, a Flemish calendar of rite and pastime set on a walled hill.",
  "Look: there is a hillside cemetery behind us and across the river the plough going in a field and in between, the gated town.",
  "Here, an obedient clerk kissing a bishop’s ring, here a frieze of seasonal games, and here the assiduous illuminator himself, bowed to his desk in a corner.",
  "In the study hall my hand was cold as a scribe’s in winter.",
  "The supervisor rustled past, sibilant, vapouring into his breviary, his welted brogues unexpectedly secular under the soutane.",
  "Now I bisected the line AB, now found my foothold in a main verb in Livy.",
  "From my dormer after lights out I revised the constellations and in the morning broke the ice on an enamelled waterjug with exhilarated self-regard.",
  "In 1944 when I was very young, my family lived in a huge house outside Chongqing, just a stone’s throw from the river that flooded every spring.",
  "We had goats, ducks and geese that chased after me, and a vegetable garden.",
  "I remember my father gathering giant tomatoes from his garden and juicing them into a large porcelain bowl on the square dining room table.",
  "I still remember the glassfuls tasting dank and dark.",
  "To this day I still cannot stand its rawness, but drink it camouflaged in a Bloody Mary.",
  "Since I’ve moved to Idaho and live in my own house, I’ve been raising vegetable gardens in the backyard every season.",
  "Among the corn, squash, eggplant, spinach and beet I’ve always saved room for a few tomato plants, even though I never eat them but give them away to friends at harvest time.",
  "In the middle of the summer I sometimes walk out of the house and listen to these plants grow, often flicking tiny black aphids from off their stems and leaves.",
  "In these moments the tangy odor of their leaves draw childhood recollections of a father dead nineteen years, images of his hands immersed in the white porcelain bowl of tomato juice from his garden, him saying Drink it, drink it, it’s only good for you, it’s vitamin C.",
  "Tonight, at exactly my father’s age in 1944 and nearly five thousand miles and fifty years from my past, I wake to hear the tomato leaves brushing gently against the backdoor of my house in the breeze, and soon after, the fruit bursting like blood in the burgeoning quarter moon.",
  "A woman who, as a thirteen-year-old girl, develops a friendship with a blind painter, a painter who is going blind.",
  "She is Catholic, lives in the country.",
  "He rents a cabin from her father, and she walks through the woods—redwood, sword fern, sorrel—to visit him.",
  "He speaks to her as an equal and shows her his work.",
  "He has begun to sculpt but still paints, relying on color and the memory of line.",
  "He also keeps English biscuits in a tin and gives her one each visit.",
  "She would like more but he never gives her more.",
  "When he undresses her, she sometimes watches him, watches his hands which are thick and square, or his left eye with a small cloud like gray phlegm on the retina.",
  "But usually not.",
  "Usually she thinks of the path to his house, whether deer had eaten the tops of the fiddleheads, why they don’t eat the peppermint saprophytes sprouting along the creek; or she visualizes the approach to the cabin, its large windows, the fuchsias in front of it where Anna’s hummingbirds always hover with dirty green plumage and jeweled throats.",
  "Sometimes she thinks about her dream, the one in which her mother wakes up with no hands.",
  "The cabin smells of oil paint, but also of pine.",
  "The painter’s touch is sexual and not sexual, as she herself is.",
  "From time to time she remembers this interval in the fall and winter of ninth grade.",
  "By spring the painter had moved.",
  "By summer her period had started.",
  "And after that her memory blurred, speeding up.",
  "One of her girlfriends French-kissed a boy on a Friday night in the third row from the back at the Tamalpais theater.",
  "The other betrayed her and the universe by beginning to hang out with the popular girls whose fathers bought them cars.",
  "When the memory of that time came to her, it was touched by strangeness because it formed no pattern with the other events in her life.",
  "It lay in her memory like one piece of broken tile, salmon-colored or the deep green of wet leaves, beautiful in itself but unusable in the design she was making.",
  "Just the other day she remembered it.",
  "Her friends were coming up from the beach with a bucket full of something, smiling and waving to her, shouting something funny she couldn’t make out, and suddenly she was there—the light flooding through the big windows, the litter of canvases, a white half-finished torso on the worktable, the sweet, wheaty odor of biscuits rising from the just-opened tin.",
  "Once there was a girl and she went for a walk by herself and came upon a hole in the ground no bigger than her finger.",
  "She sat down beside it to wait and watch so that she might see what went into it or came out.",
  "Overhead large white clouds floated in the blue but they never obscured the sun and a spider crawled over her ankle.",
  "The clouds changed shape but didn’t depart though a breeze was blowing, it carried a round brown leaf past the hole, then brought it back, and dropped it.",
  "Why is that a round brown leaf instead of a brown round one, the girl wondered, just as she had wondered earlier why the large white clouds weren’t white large ones.",
  "Dissatisfaction with how one shapes one’s thoughts is not the same as dissatisfaction with the shape of things, she said aloud and irritably, yanking at the nearest stalks of grass and pulling them out of the ground.",
  "Sulkily tossing them into the breeze, feeling sorry for herself but also thinking herself grandly or at least subtly intelligent, she failed to notice the shifting of the leaf over the hole and the.",
  "But whether it was a return or a departure, and of what, will be something we’ll learn only tomorrow night, or some night not long after it.",
  "First you must learn where the spider went.",
  "A man walking in the rain eating a banana.",
  "Where is he coming from.",
  "Where is he going.",
  "Why is he eating a banana.",
  "How hard is the rain falling.",
  "Where did he get the banana.",
  "What is the banana’s name.",
  "How fast is the man walking.",
  "Does he mind the rain.",
  "What does he have on his mind.",
  "Who is asking all these questions.",
  "Who is supposed to answer them.",
  "Does it matter.",
  "How many questions about a man walking in the rain eating a banana are there.",
  "Is the previous question one of them or is it another kind of question, not about the man or the walking or the rain.",
  "If not, what’s it a question about.",
  "Does each question raise another question.",
  "If so, what’s the point.",
  "If not, what will the final question be.",
  "Does the man know any of the answers.",
  "Does he enjoy bananas.",
  "Walking in the rain.",
  "Can the man feel the weight of eyes on him, the weight of questions.",
  "Why does the banana’s bright yellow seem the only color, the last possible color remaining in a gray world with a gray scrim of rain turning everything grayer.",
  "I know question after question after question.",
  "The only answer I know is this: all the stories I could make from this man walking in the rain eating a banana would be sad, unless I’m behind a window with you looking out at him.",
  "When I was little, there were two bakeries in Benfica.",
  "One right by the church, frequented by the bagaço-swigging proletariat, the floor was always strewn with sawdust and flattened cigarette butts, and that was called the Adega dos Ossos, where I was advised not to go for fear I might become fatally addicted to cherry brandy and cheap cigarettes and end my days playing dominoes, losing at cards and coughing into my handkerchief.",
  "It was a dark place, with lots of bottles on the walls, and in the window were more flies than custard tarts.",
  "Beyond the shelves and the spines of the bottles, a library of delirium tremens, I remember the squint-eyed bartender, his right eye furious and his left benevolently tender, and Senhor Manuel, the sacristan, who dropped by in his red surplice between masses and downed a few glasses with eucharistic unctuousness, hiding behind the fridge, afraid he might be spotted by the prior, who was all sternness and buttons from his neck to his shoes, and for whom wine, when not taken with wafers, had the devilish quality of leading the flock astray and causing them to postpone the six o’clock rosary in favor of the abominable vice of cards.",
  "The other bakery, the Benfica Paradise, almost opposite the first, was frequented after mass by ladies whose devotion was rustproof, antimagnetic and bulletproof—for example, my grandmothers and my aunts whose intimate knowledge of the saints amazed me and who hastened to teach me the catechism after I asked, pointing my finger at the Holy Spirit What’s that sparrow doing there?",
  "Explaining to me that God was not a sparrow, he was a dove, and I immediately imagined him in Praça de Camões eating out of the hands of pensioners, which hardly seemed to me an activity compatible with the creation of the universe.",
  "Paradise was filled by ladies after mass and by men during it.",
  "When a cousin of mine indignantly asked her husband why he wasn’t going to church, he replied with a small smug smile I don’t need to: I’m in Paradise already.",
  "It’s cooler and they serve beer.",
  "Unlike the Adega dos Ossos it smelled good, none of the employees had a squint, and dominoes was banned.",
  "Senhor Manuel’s surplice did not flutter furtively behind the fridge and, most important of all, my brothers and I had an open account there for cake and ice cream.",
  "At first I was so touched by the generosity of that open account I almost wept with gratitude.",
  "I realize later that it was not really an act of generosity: it was because on Sundays we had lunch at my grandmother’s house and the gift of ice cream and doughnuts was intended to distract me from the firm posterior of the cook whose charms I had recently discovered.",
  "Torn between two equally celestial Paradises, I hesitated for months on end between coconut fancies and the four rings of the stove.",
  "I finally opted for the stove.",
  "When, sometime later, the cook married a policeman all the cooks married policemen and I tried to go back to the doughnuts, my grandmother, disillusioned with my sinful ways, had canceled the account.",
  "In desperation, I accompanied her on an excursion for widows to Fátima in an attempt to win back both her affection and the cakes: not even this heroic sacrifice moved her.",
  "And I went on to live in a painful state of double orphanhood from which no cheese pastry and no apron has yet shown any interest in rescuing me.",
  "My wife and I have been meaning to buy a set of salt and pepper shakers for the past several years.",
  "We have one set, which we carry back and forth between kitchen and table.",
  "For some reason, we have never gotten around to buying the second set.",
  "Apparently it isn’t quite important enough for us to do but is important enough to make us think we ought to buy them at some point.",
  "Where’s the salt and pepper?",
  "I am heard frequently to ask.",
  "Oh, they’re in the kitchen, my wife answers wearily.",
  "At which point our son says, O. K., I know, and goes to get the salt and pepper.",
  "And so we do not remember to buy the second set.",
  "If someone were to come up to us on the street and offer to give us a set right there on the spot, we would exclaim, It’s exactly what we need, it’s amazing.",
  "But no one does.",
  "I went outside a few minutes ago to check.",
  "Instead the streets were occupied by very bland people with no interest in giving me some salt and pepper shakers.",
  "Perhaps our mañana attitude is caused by the satisfying beauty of the ones we do have.",
  "They are of the plain old diner variety, glass in vertical facets, with aluminum caps—transparent identical twins, except one is labeled moi and the other tu.",
  "We bought them for twenty-nine cents in Arkansas in 1967.",
  "They evoke home fries and coffee, and I have no doubt that there is someone who just by looking at them can describe the society that produced them, just as you can read this and know me.",
  "Fydor was a small man and he hunted bears.",
  "He knew everything there was to know about them: by the shape and size of a footprint read the age, weight, and speed of an animal; he knew their seasons of amorous encounters and the wild gardens they haunted for honey.",
  "And the bears knew Fydor: his tics, his tenacity, and his peculiar smell—rancid as old fat forgotten at the bottom of a can.",
  "Still, Fydor was the more cunning.",
  "By the roots of windblown trees he dug deep traps and made them secret beneath weavings of bracken and leaves.",
  "Many times in the passing of the year would a bear sink with a nauseating thud to be stung by Fydor’s arrows, enfevered with sleep, and hauled off to one of the many stout cages he kept in a cellar called home.",
  "Fydor hated his bears yet could not live without them.",
  "Their intimate habits, their torments and hungers excited him, sickened him, obsessed him.",
  "He thrived in the stench of their fur, their urine, and their tears.",
  "And in time the bears became obsessed with Fydor.",
  "Locked into their cages like flies in amber, they turned to him—for he was the only thing they could turn to.",
  "They watched him, memorized his habits: the way he shuffled across the littered floors, or held a pan of water beneath a tap.",
  "In time the bears knew Fydor better than a woman knows her man after sharing a half century of boredom and bed.",
  "And as alchemists fool with foul matter changing colors and structures, the bears—woolly and immense—entered into Fydor’s dreams, and changed Fydor.",
  "Night after night they lumbered down the narrow passages of Fydor’s mind to browse its rag stalls, its cut-rate china shops, leaving droppings, making drafts, causing sunset changes.",
  "They brought burdens of flowers, of fire; as at a shrine, they drugged the air.",
  "And vines grew inside Fydor’s mind, and halls of green shadow; lean hills, red earth, and places of perpetual picnic.",
  "Fydor’s skull—barren before—sprouted grass.",
  "His dim, fly-ridden eyes grew luminous.",
  "Bears were now coursing through his blood, inhabiting his heart, his liver, his testicles.",
  "His nerves writhed bears.",
  "His skin crawled bears.",
  "His bowels groaned: Bears.",
  "His cock yearned: Bears.",
  "He ate, slept, dreamed, fucked, and defecated bears until waking in a frenzy of longing, his eyes wild and circling the room like bears on bicycles, he ran to them, his pants bulging with longing and with keys.",
  "Fingers trembling, he found the locks and set them free to lumber off into the night.",
  "And Fydor followed them.",
  "With a gruff expression of joy half human, half brute, followed his makers into the forest.",
  "Another beast among beasts; perhaps less agile, less ferocious perhaps.",
  "I was running to school in fourth grade to get to class before the bell and as I rounded a busy corner I banged into a tall man rushing from the other direction and I was thrown into the air.",
  "He weighed so much more than I that I sailed for quite a ways before landing on the sidewalk.",
  "Are you all right?",
  "The man bent over me.",
  "His overcoat was a fine camel’s hair, such as I had seen only in the movies.",
  "He had on a soft beige scarf and brown woolen gloves and a brown fedora.",
  "I’m so sorry, it was my fault completely.",
  "Are you all right?",
  "I nodded, laughing now at the comic spill I had taken, like a cartoon character.",
  "How could I explain to him that it had been a pleasure to fly through the air, that there was something even comforting about a collision with such a manly, yet considerate, adult as this stranger.",
  "I pulled my sticky palms off the sidewalk.",
  "The skin was torn up, and bleeding.",
  "Here, I think I’ve got a Kleenex, he said.",
  "He reached into his pocket, felt around, and came up with a monogrammed handkerchief.",
  "I stared at the sharp crease in his pants as he crouched alongside me, brushing off the dirt; I was so in love with him that I felt too embarrassed to look at his face.",
  "Does that hurt much?",
  "No, it doesn’t hurt at all, I lied.",
  "I just didn’t see you.",
  "I was in too big of a hurry, I guess.",
  "I was also in a hurry.",
  "This corner is very tricky.",
  "People always seem to have accidents here.",
  "I wondered how he knew that.",
  "As though he could read my mind, he went on to explain: I have a law office nearby, and I see these accident cases all the time.",
  "Suddenly the words Notary Public popped into my mind.",
  "I had read them on golden decals in store windows and wondered often what they meant.",
  "Are you a Notary Public?",
  "No, just a lawyer, he laughed gently.",
  "My name’s Tony, Tony Bauer it sounded like.",
  "My office is right across Roebling Street, on the second floor.",
  "Why don’t you come visit me sometime?",
  "Do you think you’ll be able to walk now?",
  "Maybe we should take you to a drugstore first and get them to put some iodine on your hand.",
  "I’m all right, I said, letting him help me up.",
  "He handed me my blue-and-red bookbag.",
  "Only now did I realize I felt dizzy from the blow.",
  "Everything was whirling with black outlines in the winter snow.",
  "I was going to have another of my headaches.",
  "Well—goodbye for now.",
  "It was a pleasure meeting you, he said, and I felt he really meant it.",
  "Too bad it had to come about this way.",
  "Then the stranger took off one glove, and was careful not to hurt my bruise in his handshake.",
  "I had never seen an adult show a child such tact.",
  "As his back turned and he walked away, I had the peculiar urge to yell out, Daddy.",
  "Afterward I often tried rounding that same corner at full speed, but no one ever banged into me again.",
  "After the first few hours he came to feel quite at ease inside the belly of the whale.",
  "He found himself a dry, mildly fluorescent corner near one of the ribs, and settled down there on some huge organ it was springy as a waterbed.",
  "Everything—the warmth, the darkness, the odor of the sea—stirred in him memories of an earlier comfort.",
  "His mother’s womb?",
  "Or was it even before that, at the beginning of the circle which death would, perhaps soon, complete?",
  "He had known of God’s mercy, but he had never suspected God’s sense of humor.",
  "With nothing to do now until the next installment, he leaned back against the rib and let his mind rock back and forth.",
  "And often, for hours on end, during which he would lose track of Ninevah and Tarshish, his mission, his plight, himself, resonating through the vault: the strange, gurgling, long-breathed-out, beautiful song.",
  "I arrived in a plane but love the harbour.",
  "And the turning on of electricity in ships, portholes of moon, the blue glide of a tug, the harbour road and its ship chandlers, soap makers, ice on bicycles, the hidden anonymous barber shops behind the pink dirt walls of Reclamation Street.",
  "One frail memory dragged up out of the past—going to the harbour to say goodbye to a sister or mother, dusk.",
  "For years I loved the song, Harbour Lights, and later in my teens danced disgracefully with girls, humming Sea of Heartbreak.",
  "There is nothing wise about a harbour, but it is real life.",
  "It is as sincere as a Singapore cassette.",
  "Infinite waters cohabit with flotsam on this side of the breakwater and the luxury liners and Maldive fishing vessels steam out to erase calm sea.",
  "Who was I saying goodbye to?",
  "Automatically as I travel on the tug with my brother-in-law, a pilot in the harbour, I sing the lights in the harbour don’t shine for me.",
  "But I love it here, skimming out into the night anonymous among the lazy commerce, my nieces dancing on the breakwater as they wait, the lovely swallowing of thick night air as it carves around my brain, blunt, cleaning itself with nothing but this anonymity, with the magic words.",
  "Jesus got up one day a little later than usual.",
  "He had been dreaming so deep there was nothing left in his head.",
  "What was it?",
  "A nightmare, dead bodies walking all around him, eyes rolled back, skin falling off.",
  "But he wasn’t afraid of that.",
  "It was a beautiful day.",
  "How bout some coffee?",
  "Don’t mind if I do.",
  "Take a little ride on my donkey, I love that donkey.",
  "Hell, I love everybody.",
  "The first astronaut to reach the Moon proclaimed: One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.",
  "Neil Armstrong, his head entombed in a white bubble, his eyes obliterated by Moonresilient plastic, gravity-less in a bloated space suit, planted the U. S.",
  "Flag right where he stood.",
  "Later, Armstrong realized his mistake.",
  "He was supposed to have said: One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.",
  "As you read this, the Moon is moving away from the Earth.",
  "Each year the Moon steals some of Earth’s rotational energy and uses it to propel itself about 3.8 centimeters higher in its orbit.",
  "He had never encountered a parasite he didn’t, in some way, envy for a kind of perverse talent.",
  "The tidal forces of the Moon—and the Sun—don’t act only on the oceans, they act on the land too.",
  "Stand on the equator, and the land beneath you will rise and fall as much as twenty-one inches over the course of twenty-four hours.",
  "Vertigo restrained her from standing near expansive plate-glass windows on the upper floors of top-heavy skyscrapers.",
  "She teetered on high heels, the foundation undulating beneath her feet, or maybe she was moonstruck again.",
  "The Moon is about the same age as Earth.",
  "When the Moon was created, it was much closer to Earth and appeared ten times larger in the sky.",
  "In Sunday school, he asked his teacher, Why did God make the Moon without people?",
  "His father told him the moon was too cold for people, it was the dark side of God’s work; then his mother broke in, Your father’s being funny.",
  "Look at the TV. Michael Jackson, honey, he’s moon-walking.",
  "The Moon is full when the Earth is between the Sun and Moon, it is a New Moon when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth.",
  "Nocturnal creatures, cats nightly play and prance, hunting mice, hearing their faint movements behind plaster walls, while their owners beseech moon gods for love and power.",
  "The Moon is not a planet, but a satellite of the Earth.",
  "Being an identical twin was way cooler than being a virtual one—adopted at the same time, same age, but studies showed virtuals were very different people.",
  "He and his brother were unique, even if they looked the same, and he didn’t moon about his lost individuality, the way his twin did.",
  "An afterglow—also called post-luminescence—is a wide arc of glowing light that can sometimes be seen high in the western sky at twilight; it is caused by fine particles of dust scattering light in the upper atmosphere.",
  "She loved the line, When a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets.",
  "She scratched his right arm and nudged him.",
  "Naked, you don’t have pockets, he said, unless you’re a fucking kangaroo.",
  "Moonlight did nothing for this guy.",
  "Alan Shepard, when he was on the Moon, hit a golf ball and drove it 2400 feet, nearly half a mile.",
  "The moon is made of green cheese, and that crater on it, it’s really a man in the moon.",
  "And I haven’t drunk any moonshine.",
  "At the full Moon, the times of moonrise and moonset have advanced so that the Moon rises about the same time the Sun sets, and the Moon sets about the same time the sun rises.",
  "Their honeymoon, after years of living together, still scared up traditional illusions, intimations of ecstasy, a time out from reality, and when the second night of connubial bliss yawned on, she quoted George Meredith, Where may these lunatics have gone to spend the Moon.",
  "Ramadan begins with the sighting of the new crescent Moon in the ninth month of the lunar calendar.",
  "But whose sighting counts?",
  "She read the first sentence of the book: A white dog bayed at the Moon, a true moon-dog, with moon-blindness, more blind sometimes than others.",
  "The writer must be a lunatic.",
  "Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, a geological surveyor who educated the Apollo mission astronauts about craters, never made it to the Moon.",
  "He was rejected as an astronaut because of medical problems.",
  "After he died, his ashes were placed on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft on January 6, 1999.",
  "And fulfilled Dr. Shoemaker’s last wish.",
  "Once in a blue moon, the tides pull at us.",
  "They invoke humans to recall primitive ancestors who shouted at the sky, noisemakers who yowled in the dark, beckoning forces and spirits to aid their survival.",
  "Now, domesticated dogs guard their masters lives, and house cats daydream about orangutans swinging happily from branch to branch.",
  "Human beings cannot stop being afraid of the dark or imagining complete freedom.",

  "When Mr. and Mrs. Job Sheldon reached Ohio in 1800, with seven children, two oxen, and a bulging wagon, they were greeted by a bone-rattling thunderstorm.",
  "The children wailed.",
  "Mrs. Sheldon spoke of returning to Connecticut.",
  "The oxen pretended to be stone outcroppings, and would budge neither forward nor backward for all of Mr. Sheldon’s thwacking.",
  "Lightning toppled so many oaks and elms across the wagon track, in any case, that even a dozen agreeable oxen would have done them no good.",
  "More precisely, they spent the night squatting in mud beneath the wagon, trying to keep dry.",
  "Mrs. Sheldon kept saying there had never been any storms even remotely like this one back in Connecticut.",
  "Nor any cheap land, her husband added.",
  "No land’s cheap if you perish before setting eyes on it, she said.",
  "And that ended talk for the night.",
  "Every few minutes, Mrs. Sheldon would count the children, touching each head in turn, to make sure none of the seven had vanished in the deluge.",
  "Next morning it was hard to tell just where the wagon track had been, there were so many trees down.",
  "Husband and wife tried cutting their way forward.",
  "After chopping up and dragging aside only a few felled trees, and with half the morning gone, they decided Mr. Sheldon should go fetch help from Aurora, their destination.",
  "On the land-company map they had carried from the East, Aurora was advertised as a village, with mill and store and clustered cabins.",
  "But the actual place turned out to consist of a surveyor’s post, topped by a red streamer.",
  "So Mr. Sheldon walked to the next village shown on the map— Hudson—which fortunately did exist, and there he found eight men who agreed to help him clear the road.",
  "Their axes flashed for hours in the sunlight before they reached the wagon.",
  "The children huddled in shirts while their outer garments dried on nearby bushes.",
  "Mrs. Sheldon sat fully dressed and shivering.",
  "With the track cleared, the oxen still could not move the wagon through the mud until all nine men and one woman and every child except the toddler and the baby put their shoulders to the wheels.",
  "Even though they reached Aurora after nightfall, making out the surveyor’s post in lantern light, the eight ax men insisted on returning immediately to their own homes.",
  "The blades glinted on their shoulders as they disappeared from the circle of the campfire.",
  "Dry at last, Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon carried the lantern through this forest that would become their farm.",
  "Aurora meant dawn; they knew that.",
  "And their family was the dawn of dawn, the first glimmering in this new place.",
  "The next settlers did not come for three years.",
  "My mother touched the doctor’s hair—Your hair— she said.",
  "I was looking at the doctor’s eyes—black and as sad as any eyes I had ever looked at—doleful, mournful—but I thought she is hard-hearted too, this doctor.",
  "She must be hard-hearted.",
  "Hard-Hearted is part of her job.",
  "It has to be.",
  "The doctor’s hair was full and long and kinky and wavy and black.",
  "My mother’s hair is short and white and kinky and wavy and I could see why my mother was admiring the doctor’s hair.",
  "I was admiring the doctor’s body in her jeans.",
  "She had what I thought was a girlish and perfect form in her jeans, an enviable form.",
  "There were four of us backed up to the large window at the end of the hall, because I had said, Let’s go over to the window to talk—my mother, my sister, and me, and this very young woman doctor with black hair, black eyes, and jeans on.",
  "We were at the window at the hospital, at the end of a hall, down from what was left of my father.",
  "We were getting the report on my father, because I had said to the doctor, Tell us.",
  "Maybe the doctor was a little ashamed too, or belligerent, when she was telling us.",
  "Her eyes had such a film over them, so that they sparkled when she spoke of his cerebellum, about his brain stem, about the size of his cortical function.",
  "She said, He doesn’t know who he is.",
  "He does not know who he once was.",
  "He does not feel grief or frustration.",
  "He does not know who you are.",
  "What I was envying then were the doctor’s legs in her jeans.",
  "Maybe— I said, you know, maybe—he had such a big brain before—it is just possible, I said, that even if his brain has been ravaged, he is still a smart enough person.",
  "The doctor did not say anything about that.",
  "No one did.",
  "Chrissy, one of Dad’s day-shift nurses, was coming along then toward us.",
  "Her glasses are the kind my sister will not wear.",
  "She will not get glasses like that.",
  "My mother will not either.",
  "A serious person’s glasses—even if Chrissy is only just a nurse, even if she cannot explain very much about the brain, because she explained to me she has been out of school for too long— I can tell she is serious, that she is serious about me too.",
  "If she were a man, I would call what we have shared romantic love—we have shared so much, so often here—talking about my father with feeling.",
  "If she were a man—even if she couldn’t remember half of what she had learned about the brain—even if she had forgotten it all—no—if she had forgotten it all, totally, I don’t think I’d want to spend the time of day in her presence.",
  "She would disgust me if she were a man like that.",
  "So when she called us, when she said, Your father— and then when I called Dad.",
  "From the—and it sounded even to me as if I expected he would rise up—then I was ready for what I was feeling when I touched his forehead—which was still warm.",
  "His mouth was open.",
  "The front of the lower row of his teeth was showing.",
  "The teeth had never looked, each of them, so terribly small.",
  "Some of his teeth were the last things on my father that I ever touched.",
  "Reading, we are allowed to follow someone else’s train of thought as it starts off for an imaginary place.",
  "This train has been produced for us—or rather materialized and extended until it is almost nothing like the ephemeral realizations with which we’re familiar.",
  "To see words pulled one by one into existence is to intrude on a privacy of sorts.",
  "But we are familiar with the contract between spectator and performer.",
  "Now the text isn’t a train but an actress/model who takes off her school uniform piece by piece alone with the cameraman.",
  "She’s a good girl playing at being bad, all the time knowing better.",
  "She invites us to join her in that knowledge.",
  "But this is getting us nowhere.",
  "The storm came over the ridge, a rocket, dropped rain like bees, filled the corral with water and noise.",
  "I watched lightning hit the apple tree and thought: Fritters.",
  "As we packed sandbags against the flood.",
  "There was nowhere to go that wasn’t wet, the squall had punched a hole in the cabin roof and the barn was knee-high in mud.",
  "We’ll bury Jess later, when the river recedes, before the ground turns hard again.",
  "Shot by a monkey, Elsa leaned against the banyan, held a bandage to the wound.",
  "They’d entered camp just before dawn, made off with a pistol, some candy bars, and a Desmond Morris book.",
  "We counted as six shots rang out, one of them finding poor Elsa’s arm.",
  "Relieved that the simian was out of ammunition, we packed up.",
  "On the way out of camp we noticed a monkey on the riverbank, hammering at a snake with the gun.",
  "When our women had all turned into cedar trees they would group together in a corner of the graveyard and moan in the high wind.",
  "At first, with our wives gone, our spirits rose and we all thought the sound was beautiful.",
  "But then we ceased to be aware of it, grew uneasy, and quarreled more often among ourselves.",
  "That was during the year of high winds.",
  "Never before had such tumult raged in our village.",
  "Sparrows could not fly, but swerved and dropped into calm corners; clay tiles tumbled from the roofs and shattered on the pavement.",
  "Shrubbery whipped our low windows.",
  "Night after night we drank insanely and fell asleep in one another’s arms.",
  "When spring came, the winds died down and the sun was bright.",
  "At evening, long shadows fell across our floors, and only the glint of a knife blade could survive the darkness.",
  "And the darkness fell across our spirits, too.",
  "We no longer had a kind word for anyone.",
  "We went to our fields grudgingly.",
  "Silently we stared at the strangers who came to see our fountain and our church: we leaned against the lip of the fountain, our boots crossed, our maimed dogs shying away from us.",
  "Then the road fell into disrepair.",
  "No strangers came.",
  "Even the traveling priest no longer dared enter the village, though the sun blazed in the water of the fountain, the valley far below was white with flowering fruit and nut trees, and the heat seeped into the pink stones of the church at noon and ebbed out at dusk.",
  "Cats paced silently over the beaten dirt, from doorway to doorway.",
  "Birds sang in the woods behind us.",
  "We waited in vain for visitors, hunger gnawing at our stomachs.",
  "At last, somewhere deep in the heart of the cedar trees, our wives stirred and thought of us.",
  "And lazily, it seemed to us, carelessly, returned home.",
  "We looked on their mean lips, their hard eyes, and our hearts melted.",
  "We drank in the sound of their harsh voices like men coming out of the desert.",
  "I have almost nailed my left thumb to the 2 x 4 brace that holds the deck together.",
  "This Saturday morning in June, I have sawed 2 x 6s, T-squared and levelled everything with three bubbles sealed in green glass, and now the sweat on my tongue tastes like what I am.",
  "I know I’m alone, using leverage to swing the long boards into place, but at times it seems as if there are two of us working side by side like old lovers guessing each other’s moves.",
  "This hammer is the only thing I own of yours, and it makes me feel I have carpentered for years.",
  "Even the crooked nails are going in straight.",
  "The handsaw glides through grease.",
  "The toenailed stubs hold.",
  "The deck has risen up around me, and now it’s strong enough to support my weight, to not sway with this old, silly, wrong-footed dance I’m about to throw my whole body into.",
  "Plumbed from sky to ground, this morning’s work can take nearly anything.",
  "With so much uproar and punishment, footwork and euphoria, I’m almost happy this Saturday.",
  "I walk back inside and here you are.",
  "Plain and simple as the sunlight on the tools outside.",
  "Daddy, if you’d come back a week ago, or day before yesterday, I would have been ready to sit down and have a long talk with you.",
  "There were things I wanted to say.",
  "So many questions I wanted to ask, but now they’ve been answered with as much salt and truth as we can expect from the living.",
  "He could be just one more erstwhile aristocrat lightfooting it from the guillotine who’s crossed the Atlantic to research Rousseau’s wonders of nature at first hand.",
  "And he is, but tonight, writing in his travel journal, he’ll make his own contribution: the invention of the literary beauty of moonlight.",
  "It’s a concept destined to fascinate and console the melancholic children and love-starved wives of the bourgeoisie he loathes.",
  "It happens because he can’t stand the smell of the frontier inn where he’s stopped for the night: an earth-floored room with a fire in the middle.",
  "Everyone lies crowded together with their feet near the embers, their bodies radiating out, Indian and trapper alike.",
  "In a dream he can’t share, they become greasy spokes of a great, breathing wheel.",
  "The wheel lifts itself upright, moves, then begins to roll along a rutted trail, deeper and deeper into the new world.",
  "I accompanied him to prison, taking the cell next to his, but only to make sure he wouldn’t escape.",
  "That was the cover story, but only a credulous fool would believe it.",
  "We had taken a tour of chateau towers and church spires, disguising ourselves as clerics, but only to kill the time between assignments.",
  "One night as I slept a convention of architects and surveillance experts assembled a model prison in San Francisco but only because the California state legislature was throwing money at the problem of overcrowded correctional facilities.",
  "I slept fitfully, awakened by fears or loud neighbors, and decided to stay awake, but only because I had homework to do and now was as good a time as any to do it.",
  "A commotion outside caused me to go to the window but only for a few minutes.",
  "I opened the window and stuck my head out but only to see whether a revolution had commenced.",
  "I could see the eyes of the people in the street below, but only a few of them looked familiar.",
  "The people were looking up, but only because of a strong light flashing from the top of the building.",
  "There was misery in their eyes, but only because they had forgotten why they had gathered at four in the morning in this inauspicious part of the city.",
  "My son is coughing in his sleep next to me in my bed, where he has come to spend what is left of this night.",
  "My son’s cough is red, noisy, and loose, a clattering wagon on its jagged way down, with me all ears to the racheting sound of my child-self in the bed next to Dad, who is tossing and threatening.",
  "Stop coughing, Dad says.",
  "You’ll wake the dead.",
  "Bat flap and smoke in the dark of his voice make me hold back this need, hold back from Dad, whose fleshy skull clenches every raw cough I cough.",
  "I want to be still.",
  "I fix on the chafed, pitted folds at his neck with a promise to sleep, as if my quiet could ease and uncoil this turned-away man, but I can’t and it’s out, rude air through the pipes, a dry sound full of rust.",
  "Dad says, I’m too old for this.",
  "He says, Oblige me, and I watch the words turn in this room he calls his own, Dad’s porch, sleeping headquarters, off-limits.",
  "How did I get here, close enough to smell him?",
  "That’s what I want to know: How did I?",
  "Rolled, damp toweling—the kind Dad sometimes swipes at me—he smells like that.",
  "He smells like shaving water, where he floats his brush and lets me blow apart the suds before he snaps a towel, says, Out.",
  "That’s enough; go get dressed.",
  "I only pretend to leave.",
  "He never shuts the door all the way, and I want to see, and I can, if I am careful, if I am clever.",
  "From where I am hiding, just outside the bathroom door, I can see him.",
  "I can see him oiling his back under the sunlamp.",
  "It makes me feel lazy just watching him: the way my father massages himself and rolls his shoulders in this heat.",
  "So much heat, so much white in wild refraction off the swivel mirror; I see he has to squint to see the parts of himself in the magnified side, where the black eye, lashless and fast, his eye, finds me. I hold to the edge of my bed and watch him sleep.",
  "I don’t move.",
  "I let my son take up all the room he wants, knowing he will slip away before I am even awake, and even after I have been so quiet, so good.",
  "Tonight as I boarded my train of thought and entered the first class compartment of my mind, I thought of Margaret Atwood who wrote, I am in love with Raymond Chandler because of his interest in furniture.",
  "Baudelaire, I am no one but the insatiable identities that descend upon me and tonight it is you.",
  "I’ve thought, if Baudelaire were not Baudelaire, I would be Baudelaire, though in truth I have thought the same about Walter Benjamin when he says I paraphrase, I am in love with Baudelaire because of his interest in furniture.",
  "When writing about furniture Baudelaire is free from capitalism’s philosophy and history and archaeology and is enthralled by upholstery, and this is a way of thinking and being that is wholly new in the world and was made so by Baudelaire.",
  "No quotation is innocent.",
  "Every quotation is an act of ventriloquism.",
  "Every ventriloquism is an usurpation.",
  "P. Blackmur said and here I do not quote but paraphrase: If you say there is no blackbird in a poem immediately a blackbird alights on the branch of a line.",
  "If you say, I am only quoting, immediately your voice guiltily alights on the branches of the words.",
  "In Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism, as Walter Benjamin carries forward the great cross of his love for you, as he is nailing himself to his love for you, at the height of his passion, he stops on page seventy-one to quote that gnat Maxime Du Camp: Baudelaire had what is a great defect in a writer, a defect of which he was not aware: he was ignorant.",
  "He remained unacquainted with history, physiology, archeology and philosophy.",
  "He had little interest in the outside world; he may have been aware of it, but he certainly did not study it.",
  "And in doing so, at the height of his love, Walter Benjamin enters and is entered, he becomes Maxime Du Camp.",
  "Baudelaire knew nothing, says sneers Benjamin.",
  "Why, I have always wondered, does he do that?",
  "Cher Baudelaire, I believe that behind or inside Benjamin’s quotation from Maxime Du Camp, growing upon it as a vine grows on a trellis, there lives the envy and sorrow of a man cut off from the possibility of another’s experience.",
  "There lives the envy of a man who knew history for another man who did not; there lives the love of a man Benjamin who loved philosophy for a man you who did not love it and by extension would not have loved him Benjamin or perhaps could not love him.",
  "Would you have wasted an afternoon on Benjamin?",
  "Is there even one syllable in you to suggest that you care at all about Benjamin?",
  "Which must have hurt.",
  "I, on the other hand, am perfectly aware that you adore me because we adore so many of the same things—furniture, women’s dresses, recreational drugs.",
  "In every line and flourish I hear you calling out to me as I sit here in the furnishings of the future; I see you waving to me in the windows of my train of thought as though you were waving to yourself at some time in the future; as though I were you with my poems filled with dresses and drugs and unfaithful women, some of whom are me.",
  "How grateful you are that I have resurrected you, that you can live in the present with all its wonderful appurtenances, with its fantastic advances in perfumes, the advent of hair gel, the Alps of the four-inch stiletto.",
  "How lucky you are, cher Baudelaire, to have found me to shelter you, to have found the succulent hallways of my lines, and the shimmering windows of my tropes, and the sticky navels of the little hash pipes I have left lying about for you, the ease, the comfort, the respite my verse provides you.",
  "Or maybe not.",
  "I sit on my train and watch capitalism struggle in the windows.",
  "In the city of the mind the great alcove of night closes over us.",
  "Even over you, Baudelaire, who invented a world that had never before existed—a completely interior world of upholstery without philosophy— and in so doing gained the undying envy of the future Walter Benjamin, who was sentenced to live inside a world outside and who, therefore, had to save himself from that world and its history by committing suicide at Hotel de Francia in Port-Bou in September of 1940.",
  "I milked the cows, I churned the butter, I stored the cheese, I baked the bread, I brewed the tea, I washed the clothes, I dressed the children; the cat meowed, the dog barked, the horse neighed, the mouse squeaked, the fly buzzed, the goldfish living in a bowl stretched its jaws; the door banged shut, the stairs creaked, the fridge hummed, the curtains billowed up, the pot boiled, the gas hissed through the stove, the tree branches heavy with snow crashed against the roof; my heart beat loudly thud.",
  "Thud. , tiny beads of water gathered on my nose, my hair went limp, my waist grew folds, I shed my skin; lips have trembled, tears have flowed, cheeks have puffed, stomachs have twisted with pain; I went to the country, the car broke down, I walked back; the boat sailed, the waves broke, the horizon tipped, the jetty grew small, the air stung, some heads bobbed, some handkerchiefs fluttered; the drawers didn’t close, the faucets dripped, the paint peeled, the walls cracked, the books tilted over, the rug no longer lay out flat; I ate my food, I chewed each mouthful thirty-two times, I swallowed carefully, my toe healed; there was a night, it was dark, there was a moon, it was full, there was a bed, it held sleep; there was movement, it was quick, there was a being, it stood still, there was a space, it was full, then there was nothing; a man came to the door and asked, Are the children ready yet?",
  "Will they bear their mother’s name?",
  "I suppose you have forgotten that my birthday falls on Monday after next?",
  "Will you come to visit me in hospital? ; I stood up, I sat down, I stood up again; the clock slowed down, the post came late, the afternoon turned cool; the cat licked his coat, tore the chair to shreds, slept in a drawer that didn’t close; I entered a room, I felt my skin shiver, then dissolve, I lighted a candle, I saw something move, I recognized the shadow to be my own hand, I felt myself to be one thing; the wind was hard, the house swayed, the angiosperms prospered, the mammal-like reptiles vanished Is the Heaven to be above?",
  "Is the Hell below?",
  "Does the Lamb still lie meek?",
  "Does the Lion roar?",
  "Will the streams all run clear?",
  "Will we kiss each other deeply later? ; in the peninsula some ancient ships are still anchored, in the field the ox stands still, in the village the leopard stalks its prey; the buildings are to be tall, the structures are to be sound, the stairs are to be winding, in the rooms sometimes there is to be a glow; the hats remain on the hat stand, the coats hang dead from the pegs, the hyacinths look as if they will bloom—I know their fragrance will be overpowering; the earth spins on its axis, the axis is imaginary, the valleys correspond to the mountains, the mountains correspond to the sea, the sea corresponds to the dry land, the dry land corresponds to the snake whose limbs are now reduced; I saw a man, He was in a shroud, I sat in a rowboat, He whistled sweetly to me, I narrowed my eyes, He beckoned to me, Come now; I turned and rowed away, as if I didn’t know what I was doing.",
  "I am turned into an animal: a weasel.",
  "I feel humiliated and small and stupid.",
  "Incredibly, my girlfriend doesn’t notice when she wakes up beside me in the morning.",
  "I sit huddled on the edge of the bed, fixing on her my huge, mournful, brown weasel eyes.",
  "This morning you put on the coffee water, she sighs, and she heads out to the shower.",
  "Of course this simple request is quite beyond me, because of my size and because of my simple-minded digital capabilities.",
  "Oh thanks, my girlfriend mutters with weary sarcasm, coming into the kitchen and finding the kettle on its side on the floor, where I had sent it tumbling with my hapless maneuverings.",
  "She slams the fridge door when she gets out the milk.",
  "At the table, she eats her breakfast in silence dully ignoring me.",
  "I sit in my chair, feeling absurdly small and puny in it, with a bit of tail hanging down back.",
  "I have nothing to eat, so I fall to licking my paws.",
  "For God’s sake, can’t you stop biting your damn nails?",
  "My girlfriend murmurs.",
  "I stop and stare at her.",
  "Something in me snaps.",
  "You unfeeling brute.",
  "I screech at her, all my woebegoneness flooding into rage.",
  "Here I’ve been turned into some kind of rodent right under your nose—and you haven’t even noticed.",
  "She stares back, dumbfounded.",
  "Her mouth is open.",
  "Then her eyes flash.",
  "She slams down her coffee mug so that it slops all over the table.",
  "Look who’s talking.",
  "She grabs handfuls of her large, loose ears.",
  "What about what’s happened to me?.",
  "Camille Claudel lived the last thirty years of her life in an asylum wondering why, writing letters to her brother the poet, who had signed the papers.",
  "Come visit me, she says.",
  "Remember I am living here with madwomen, days are long.",
  "She did not smoke or stroll.",
  "She refused to sculpt.",
  "Although they gave her sleep stones—marble and granite and porphyry—she broke them then collected the pieces and buried these outside the walls at night.",
  "Night was when her hands grew, huger and huger until in the photograph they are like two parts of someone else loaded onto her knees.",
  "What you have heard is true.",
  "I was in his house.",
  "His wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar.",
  "His daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night.",
  "There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him.",
  "The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house.",
  "On the television was a cop show.",
  "It was in English.",
  "Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man’s legs or cut his hands to lace.",
  "On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores.",
  "We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid.",
  "The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread.",
  "I was asked how I enjoyed the country.",
  "There was a brief commercial in Spanish.",
  "His wife took everything away.",
  "There was some talk of how difficult it had become to govern.",
  "The parrot said hello on the terrace.",
  "The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table.",
  "My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing.",
  "The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home.",
  "He spilled many human ears on the table.",
  "They were like dried peach halves.",
  "There is no other way to say this.",
  "He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass.",
  "It came alive there.",
  "I am tired of fooling around he said.",
  "As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves.",
  "He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air.",
  "Something for your poetry, no?",
  "Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice.",
  "Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.",
  "In North Africa, Delacroix had seen a Jewish wedding which he described extensively in his journal: She is silhouetted halfway against the door, halfway against the wall; nearer the foreground, an older woman, with a great deal of white, which conceals her almost entirely, the shadows full of reflections; white in the shadows.",
  "Nine years later, in the Salon of 1841, he exhibited a painting entitled, Jewish Wedding.",
  "After the wedding, the congratulations, the eating, drinking, and dancing, the bride and bridegroom walked out into the night; her white dress turned blue; it grew smaller; finally a speck of dust was blinked away.",
  "On March 11, 1854, Eugene Delacroix sat down at his favorite desk a gift—actually one of many he had received from a Pasha in Tangiers and wrote in his journal: A long interruption in these poor notes of daily happenings: I feel very badly about it; these trifling pages written down in such a fugitive way seem to me all that is left of my life, the more it flows away.",
  "My lack of memory makes them necessary for me; since the beginning of the year, the steady work needed for finishing at the Hôtel de Ville has been distracting me too much; since I finished it, and that will soon be a month since, my eyes are in a bad state, I am afraid to read and to write.",
  "He felt as he put down the pen and straightened his back that the rest of his evenings, his nights and days, would be filled with a new kind of darkness.",
  "At first he thought he could turn to his friends.",
  "But Mme Sand was on her way to Vienna, and Chopin had not received him twice in the last week.",
  "Most likely, he was in the throes of composition.",
  "Delacroix felt his fears being heightened by the underlying silence of day becoming night.",
  "He wished he were sitting in the green brocade chair in Frederic’s apartment, listening to him playing the piano.",
  "The evening’s shadows, both inside and outside, were beginning to overlap, while he remained seated at his desk, his chin cupped between his hands, his eyes closed.",
  "He remembered that twenty years ago M.",
  "Gros had told him that he had once lived a life devoted to excess.",
  "But now he, M.",
  "Gros, drank nothing but water with dinner.",
  "In fact, being deprived of a cigar after dinner was the greatest hardship of all the ones he had to face.",
  "Delacroix wondered what he had forgotten about that evening.",
  "What moments would never be retrieved?",
  "It was well past midnight, yet restlessness permeated his movements.",
  "The moon slit the thick velvet drapes, but it couldn’t reach him.",
  "Instead, on either side of his bed two strips of light wavered along the carpet.",
  "Outside, someone remarked on the sultry beauty of the night in a high silly voice.",
  "I am afraid to read and to write.",
  "The lamp continued flickering; three dull concentric circles peered back from the ceiling.",
  "Delacroix rolled over on his side; he faced the night table, as he had done many times in the last few hours.",
  "Except for the table, everything had become a shadow; the chair in the corner was a blotch of darkness.",
  "He turned back to the table.",
  "A pile of books lay there, precariously balanced.",
  "They were a staircase rising in memory of the house that no longer surrounds them.",
  "I was with my mother on the S. S.",
  "Jehangir, crossing the Indian Ocean.",
  "Midway on the journey I turned five.",
  "Bombay was far behind and Port Sudan still to come.",
  "It was my first sea voyage.",
  "Until then I had lived on solid land, on the Indian subcontinent and all my journeys had been by train or car or on small wooden boats on the canals and waterways of the coastal region I come from.",
  "The sea cast me loose.",
  "The sea tore away from me all that I had.",
  "In doing so, it gave me an interior life far sooner than I would have had otherwise, but at great cost.",
  "I was forced to enter another life, the life of the imagination.",
  "But it was not as yet the life of language.",
  "I had few words at my disposal, and those I had came from several languages that cohabited within my head.",
  "What I felt as a child and held deep within myself quite exceeded the store of words within my reach.",
  "This is something that I feel, even now as an adult.",
  "The struggle for words, the struggle to be human, is coexistent for me with the craft of poetry.",
  "On my fifth birthday I was plunged into a world with no before and no after.",
  "A child can fall into the sea, never to reappear.",
  "A mother can appear out of the waves, only to vanish, reappear, and then vanish again.",
  "The sea has no custom, no ceremony.",
  "It allows a theater for poetry, for a voice that cries out, that splits into one, two, three or more, chanting the figurations of the soul, marking a migrant memory.",
  "The day I turned five, I stuck my head out through the porthole of our cabin and saw ceaseless water.",
  "On and on, until my eyes and neck hurt, I kept watch.",
  "When I pulled my head back in I knew the sea was painted on the inside of my eyelids, would never leave me.",
  "Sometimes the syllables of poetry well up, waves on the surface of the sea, and they burst as flying fish might, struck by light.",
  "Sometimes I feel this is how I began, a wordless poet, a child on the surface of wide water with all that she loved torn from her, cast into ceaseless suspension.",
  "The page on which I write is a live restless thing, soul-sister to the unselving sea.",
  "Can Mother muster enough thrust to leave the earth in a sudden leap?",
  "Does Father need words of encouragement, a rabbit’s foot, a running start?",
  "Will they rise above our suburb at dusk and see it studded with lights?",
  "Wind must play havoc with mother’s dress, her stole blown back like a vapor trail.",
  "Father’s suit, diminishing, dark, will become part of the night.",
  "What instinct helps them scout for the house, find the right street, land on their feet?",
  "How do they breathe, cleaving the air with such soft hats?",
  "At the house of the host, can you hear the hail of guests on the roof, the garage, the grass, come eager to mingle, smoke, and tell jokes?",
  "Over a cover of cold clouds, bearing bouquets, bottles of wine, decks of cards and dominoes, a sparse arc of punctual people migrate behind the horizon.",
  "While aloft like a league of ghosts or gods, does their vision slip through thick ceilings?",
  "Can they watch us mimic their kisses, embrace our own backs, burrow hands beneath our bedclothes?",
  "Spying their children aglow on earth with a meager heat, do flying parents cry like geese?",
  "Nearly everyone had left that bar in the middle of winter except the hardcore.",
  "It was the coldest night of the year, every place shut down, but not us.",
  "Of course we noticed when she came in.",
  "We were Indian ruins.",
  "She was the end of beauty.",
  "No one knew her, the stranger whose tribe we recognized, her family related to deer, if that’s who she was, a people accustomed to hearing songs in pine trees, and making them hearts.",
  "The woman inside the woman who was to dance naked in the bar of misfits blew deer magic.",
  "Henry Jack, who could not survive a sober day, thought she was Buffalo Calf Woman come back, passed out, his head by the toilet.",
  "All night he dreamed a dream he could not say.",
  "The next day he borrowed money, went home, and sent back the money I lent.",
  "Now that’s a miracle.",
  "Some people see vision in a burned tortilla, some in the face of a woman.",
  "This is the bar of broken survivors, the club of shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture.",
  "We who were taught not to stare drank our beer.",
  "The players gossiped down their cues.",
  "Someone put a quarter in the jukebox to relive despair.",
  "Richard’s wife dove to kill her.",
  "We had to hold her back, empty her pockets of knives and diaper pins, buy her two beers to keep her still, while Richard secretly bought the beauty a drink.",
  "How do I say it?",
  "In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses.",
  "I could say it in my own and the sacred mounds would come into focus, but I couldn’t take it in this dingy envelope.",
  "So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense.",
  "My brother-in-law hung out with white people, went to law school with a perfect record, quit.",
  "Says you can keep your laws, your words.",
  "And practiced law on the street with his hands.",
  "He jimmied to the proverbial dream girl, the face of the moon, while the players racked a new game.",
  "He bragged to us, he told her magic words and that’s when she broke, became human.",
  "But we all heard his bar voice crack: What’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?",
  "That’s what I’d like to know, what are we all doing in a place like this?",
  "You would know she could hear only what she wanted to; don’t we all?",
  "Left the drink of betrayal Richard bought her, at the bar.",
  "What was she on?",
  "We all wanted some.",
  "Put a quarter in the juke.",
  "We all take risks stepping into thin air.",
  "Our ceremonies didn’t predict this.",
  "Or we expected more.",
  "I had to tell you this, for the baby inside the girl sealed up with a lick of hope and swimming into praise of nations.",
  "This is not a rooming house, but a dream of winter falls and the deer who portrayed the relatives of strangers.",
  "The way back is deer breath on icy windows.",
  "The next dance none of us predicted.",
  "She borrowed a chair for the stairway to heaven and stood on a table of names.",
  "And danced in the room of children without shoes.",
  "You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.",
  "With four hungry children and a crop in the field.",
  "And then she took off her clothes.",
  "She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we’d all become.",
  "She was the myth slipped down through dreamtime.",
  "The promise of feast we all knew was coming.",
  "The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us.",
  "She was no slouch, and neither were we, watching.",
  "The music ended.",
  "And so does the story.",
  "I wasn’t there.",
  "But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left.",
  "He carved the coat off the dead winter lamb, wiped her blood on his pants to keep a grip, circling first the hooves and cutting straight up each leg, then punching the skin loose from muscle and bone.",
  "He tied the skin with twine over the body of the orphaned lamb so the grieving ewe would know the scent and let the orphaned lamb nurse.",
  "Or so he said.",
  "This was seduction.",
  "This was the story he told, of all the farm-boy stories he might have told; he chose the one where brutality saves a life.",
  "He wanted me to feel, when he fitted his body over mine, that this was how I would go on—this was how I would be known.",
  "Houdinize: to release or extricate oneself from confinement, as by wriggling out.",
  "You’ve certainly mastered that trick, your every alibi a Trunk Mysterioso.",
  "Harry never made excuses.",
  "Instead—hard work, repetition.",
  "A Dime Museum: you’re cracking yellow croquet balls on your cranium, trying to make a diamond materialize in a Big Mac; I’m scraping gold sequins off the floor with a dislocated big toe.",
  "He’s hanging upside down, inch-long needles dangling from his eyelids.",
  "Behold, a miracle.",
  "He shouts, then wants to know just what the hell a Big Mac is, and why we’re here.",
  "It was a bad winter, Harry: frozen birds smashing into failing gutters, our St. Bernard casting off its root-beer barrel and chasing two old cats.",
  "Then a fiendish hand crashed through the Great Beyond and grabbed me by the chi-chis.",
  "Which, of course, makes everyone laugh.",
  "Even the Dog-Faced Boy.",
  "But Harry’s up for the challenge.",
  "He crawls into a large milk can.",
  "Much mumbling and banging, then a solution signaled by the moan of a conch shell.",
  "He leaps from the can, naked from the waist up, sweating, his eyes gunmetal grey.",
  "Beware the Kalends of July.",
  "Beware anyone even using the word Kalends.",
  "And he’s deadly serious.",
  "Later, sitting on a trick coffin in a cream-colored straitjacket, he’s fed chunks of sirloin by the Bird Girl.",
  "My whole life, he says, I’ve been chasing the sound of my mother’s heartbeat.",
  "Inside the ebony box, a woman is weeping.",
  "They always dreamed of a reincarnation that would allow them to kiss in public.",
  "They died together in an accident during one of their secret rendezvous.",
  "He came back as a circus elephant and she as a petunia.",
  "Since the lifespan of petunias is very brief, this put them out of sync.",
  "In the next reincarnation they were both human, but with sixty-three years between them.",
  "She became Pope and he an adorable little girl who was granted permission to kiss his ring in an audience.",
  "I have always aspired to be a circus performer.",
  "My husband has always collected keys, starting with the pink and blue teething keys of babyhood.",
  "These two interests had no significant connection to me, yet they were the sole cause of our marital strife.",
  "My husband would come home elated at finding an unusual key.",
  "That was the signal to transport myself to the big top, imagining the ringmaster’s introduction: Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the United States and Canada, here she is, Trixie, the tiger woman.",
  "I never divulged my hobby to him.",
  "Colette of the talking poodles, Chloe, the human fly, and Rosa, the rubber lady, were foreign to him as relaxing with a good circus novel.",
  "After another exasperating weekend of key-hunting, I drifted into an uneasy sleep.",
  "I dreamed that my husband and I were an acrobatic team.",
  "He was tall and worldly in military blue and a red shirt, designed to reveal his biceps, bulging like two loaves of bread.",
  "I wore a silver tutu, accentuating my small waist and large breasts.",
  "Our act was complex, and far surpassed any that I’d seen on television or read about in histories of the Flying Capezios.",
  "Like a shooting star, I’d hurl myself from the trapeze to be caught by my husband, who held a solid gold key between his teeth.",
  "People below gasped at his dental fortitude.",
  "Although the act was perilous and required the concentration of a bibliographer transcribing into braille, we’d smile at one another like fifteen-year-olds over a coke.",
  "I woke up feeling transformed.",
  "The next Saturday my husband was startled to find me dressed before him for our weekly tour of curio shops, garbage dumps, and demolished buildings.",
  "He supposed my enthusiasm was the result of reading some gushy article about togetherness in a woman’s magazine or that my doctor had prescribed a hobby to cure my frequent headaches.",
  "Little does he know that I practice every day.",
  "Shades drawn, I hang from the crystal chandelier and propel myself across the room, landing lightly as a moth on a coat lapel.",
  "El bandido was a stereotype but he prospered in the history books and got away with riches, women, and many killings.",
  "El bandido wore the typical large sombrero, bandoliers loaded with bullets, and a huge handlebar moustache.",
  "He rode into battle on horses with his men, his victories accumulating as the masses revolted throughout the country.",
  "When he held court around huge campfires, his men huddled close and listened to every word.",
  "When his enemies were lined up against adobe walls to be shot, his men relished the opportunity to be in one of the firing squads.",
  "El bandido had a large belly and a round face, prominent features in hundreds of antique photographs of the war.",
  "His cruelty against his enemies and his love of women were legendary.",
  "His horse was a prize stallion and his soldiers were always well armed.",
  "El bandido’s hacienda was heavily guarded and the dining table was stacked with food, liquor, and boxes of the best cigars.",
  "Though he had many wives and mistresses, he slept alone on most nights, moving from one large bedroom to another in the enormous houses on his estate.",
  "When he slept, he had a recurring dream where he found himself in wet caverns where the many faces of the men he had personally shot stared at him through the dripping water.",
  "When he couldn’t sleep, he lay awake in the dark and pondered the next campaign.",
  "Each morning he sat on the edge of his bed and stared briefly at the old wooden crucifix on the far wall before leaving.",
  "El bandido rode at the head of a long column of men and horses, the cause refreshed each time the dream of the caverns came to him.",
  "Battles were lost and won, but he accumulated more power and riches as the number of dead men who had followed him rose into the thousands.",
  "When a foreign army entered the country and chased him for over four months, el bandido’s fame intensified and the stereotype grew.",
  "The few battles the two sides engaged in were minor, though more men died and more photographers took pictures.",
  "When the invading troops gave up on catching him, he sat on his horse atop a desert ridge and watched the distant dust clouds of the retreating army.",
  "As the sun began to set, el bandido waited on the ridge with three of his most trusted generals.",
  "No one spoke because he didn’t say a word.",
  "Several more years of fighting followed as towns were captured and lost and the country suffered over 200,000 dead.",
  "El bandido had three ranches near the end of the struggle and had survived two assassination attempts.",
  "The new government offered to pardon him, though his army was the largest at the end of the revolution.",
  "El bandido refused to be pardoned, though he promised not to march on the capitol and he let his men go home.",
  "The few dozen that stayed to work on his ranches were younger stereotypes of the legend.",
  "Their ambitions, guns, and women were abundant and their dreams were influenced by their loyalty to their leader.",
  "Three years after the revolt, el bandido was the richest man in the northern part of the country and he married his sixth wife.",
  "A few nights after the wedding, el bandido woke alone.",
  "The recurring dream did not visit him as often as it used to, so he lay calmly in the large bed until he heard his wife crying somewhere.",
  "Out of habit, he reached for his pistol and stepped quietly toward the next room.",
  "As he opened the door, he found his wife tied to a chair, six of his ranch hands surrounding her with drawn guns, one of them holding a pistol to the woman’s head.",
  "El bandido and his men exchanged volleys in the truest stereotype of a western gunfight.",
  "He killed four of them before the other two put nine bullets into him and two in his wife.",
  "The two men ran out to the dozens of waiting and mounted riders whose bandoliers, rifles, and faces glistened in the summer moonlight.",
  "You would like to walk lightly on snow like a squirrel, hear the whiteness crunch, handle the warm fur of fairy tales, abandon yourself to their sleep, as you would to a pillow, where you nestle your head while someone tells a story.",
  "Each time your heart creaks, you take up your thimble, your sewing kit and your needles: still more words with words, bits of wood, children’s forts, excess, access to the sky, inky fevers, a craving for blue, its melancholy of light-colored skirts; you are love’s workman.",
  "What can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments?",
  "I was small, like everyone.",
  "Life was a string of precautions: Don’t kiss the squirrel before you bury him, don’t suck candy, pop balloons, drop watermelons, watch TV. When the new gloves appeared one Christmas, tucked in soft tissue, I heard it trailing me: Don’t lose the yellow gloves.",
  "I was small, there was too much to remember.",
  "One day, waving at a stream—the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches—I let a glove go.",
  "Into the stream, sucked under the street.",
  "Since when did streets have mouths?",
  "I walked home on a desperate road.",
  "Gloves cost money.",
  "We didn’t have much.",
  "I would tell no one.",
  "I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket.",
  "I knew my mother’s eyes had tears they had not cried yet, I didn’t want to be the one to make them flow.",
  "It was the prayer I spoke secretly, folding socks, lining up donkeys in windowsills.",
  "To be good, a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night.",
  "If you don’t get in my bed, I will be good.",
  "And they listened.",
  "I had a lot to fulfill.",
  "The months rolled down like towels out of a machine.",
  "I sang and drew and fattened the cat.",
  "Don’t scream, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t fight—you could hear it anywhere.",
  "A pebble could show you how to be smooth, tell the truth.",
  "A field could show how to sleep without walls.",
  "A stream could remember how to drift and change—next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he’d only hurry up with the bread, when I saw it.",
  "The yellow glove draped on a twig.",
  "A muddy survivor.",
  "A quiet flag.",
  "Where had it been in the three gone months?",
  "I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know.",
  "There were miracles on Harvey Street.",
  "Children walked home in yellow light.",
  "Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far, but returned.",
  "A thousand miles later, what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos?",
  "Part of the difference between floating and going down.",
  "We went to the movies every Friday and Sunday.",
  "On Friday nights the Colonial filled with an oily fragrance of teenagers while we hid in the back row of the balcony.",
  "An aura of light from the projection booth curved across our shoulders, round under cotton sweaters.",
  "Sacred grunts rose in black corners.",
  "The screen was far away and spilling color—big men sweating on their horses and women with powdered breasts floating under satin.",
  "Near the end the film smelled hot and twisted as boys shuddered and girls sank down in their seats.",
  "We ran to the lobby before the lights came up to stand by the big ash can and watch them walk slowly downstairs.",
  "Mouths swollen and ripe, they drifted down like a sigh of steam.",
  "The boys held their arms tense and shuffled from one foot to the other while the girls sniffed and combed their hair in the big mirror.",
  "Outside the neon lights on Main Street flashed stripes across asphalt in the rain.",
  "They tossed their heads and shivered like ponies.",
  "On Sunday afternoons the theater was deserted, a church that smelled of something frying.",
  "Mrs. Causton stood at the door to tear tickets with her fat buttered fingers.",
  "During the movie she stood watching the traffic light change in the empty street, pushing her glasses up over her nose and squeezing a damp Kleenex.",
  "Mr. Penny was her skinny yellow father.",
  "He stood by the office door with his big push broom, smoking cigarettes and coughing.",
  "Walking down the slanted floor to our seats we heard the swish of her thighs behind the candy counter and our shoes sliding on the worn carpet.",
  "The heavy velvet curtain moved its folds.",
  "We waited, and a cavernous dark pressed close around us, its breath pulling at our faces.",
  "After the last blast of sound it was Sunday afternoon, and Mr. Penny stood jingling his keys by the office door while we asked to use the phone.",
  "Before he turned the key he bent over and pulled us close with his bony arms.",
  "Stained fingers kneading our chests, he wrapped us in old tobacco and called us his little girls.",
  "I felt his wrinkled heart wheeze like a dog on a leash.",
  "Sweethearts, he whispered.",
  "Henrik Ibsen never went anywhere without his hat.",
  "Refusing to entrust it to a hatcheck’s charge, he preferred to place it beside him, always requisitioning an empty seat at whatever cost.",
  "Its positioning was crucial and the dramatist took great pains to tilt it just right.",
  "The significance of the hat, a mystery heretofore, was only recently revealed when a packet of the playwright’s letters were sold at Sotheby’s.",
  "I spotted you this afternoon in the crook of my hat, he addressed a correspondent by the initial N thought by some to have inspired Nora.",
  "Apparently flattered by the famous man’s attention, N must have challenged him to explain.",
  "For another note dated the following day reads: Man must protect himself from beauty’s Medusa gaze.",
  "Do tell me where you plan to sit at tomorrow’s performance.",
  "I prefer pearl earrings.",
  "And yet another note concludes: The cad, the fool, the critic T rushing to congratulate me for yesterday’s premiere of P. G.",
  "Probably Peer Gynt knocked over my doffer and smashed my second set of eyes.",
  "Will have to love you blindly til I find a replacement.",
  "Ibsen, it seems, wore a pocket mirror tucked into the sweatband of his hat—which explains an obscure line crossed out in the original manuscript of A Doll’s House: Only enclosed by glass does beauty arouse manageable emotions.",
  "Crenshaw is a juicy melon.",
  "Don’t spit, and when you’re finished, wash your neck.",
  "Tonight we lead with bleeding hearts, sliced raw or scooped with a spoon.",
  "I’ll show my shank.",
  "I’d rend your cares with my shears.",
  "If I can’t scare cash from the ashen crew, this monkey wrench has scratch to back my business.",
  "This ram-shackle stack of shotguns I’m holding in my scope.",
  "I’m beady-eyed as a bug.",
  "Slippery as a sardine.",
  "Salty as a kipper.",
  "You could rehash me for breakfast.",
  "Find my shrinking awe, or share your wink.",
  "I’ll get a rash wench.",
  "We’ll crash a shower of cranes.",
  "I’m making bird seed to stick in a hen’s craw.",
  "Where I live’s a wren shack.",
  "She taught me the names of flowers: calendula, ranunculus, Iceland poppy.",
  "And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.",
  "Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus was the broom of the kidneys.",
  "I hadn’t understood at first and thought she’d used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities.",
  "I learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once told me, with unparalleled patience.",
  "Then one day she began to accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how she’d giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she had single-handedly decimated her husband’s glass collection dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet.",
  "In the doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do.",
  "We saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then became memory.",
  "With unparalleled patience I jumped through hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with unparalleled dexterity.",
  "I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her elbow.",
  "But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability to dissemble.",
  "Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor, and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity, time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on amphetamines.",
  "Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to the angry god of its vortex.",
  "Your voice is like acid on my skin, she said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me behind like so much history.",
  "Every night women in love gather outside the window and it is nothing special; coming out is what stars do, clouds, the sun when it builds up the nerve and then has to just blurt out.",
  "Their thoughts collect there, outside, the window of no value to them unless they marvel at coincidence; the window is just how I know it happens.",
  "I am not part of the circle although every game I played as a girl was round.",
  "By morning there is fruit on branches not meant to bear witness anymore, that birds avoid and that embarrasses me so I don’t taste it; I don’t find out if they’re edible berries, and even if they were, I’d let them shrink and drop dried; I can’t see myself snatching berries, especially not from a shrub so brambled, the branches look as if the feet of little birds tangled and broke off to appease beaks that had to get into those berries no matter what.",
  "This is the wrong thing to say because someone will start thinking that women in love set traps, bait bushes, trick birds, act out fables in which birds are made to always fly, to exhaust their wings, to be up soaring to death because they can’t resort to landing.",
  "This is how the great hoverers are made.",
  "But women in love can do more than this, making is too traditionally and industrially valued to be a special accomplishment, a reason to gather when light isn’t that good and there are no decent shadows, and the lit square and rectangular windows are irregular stars so big in their closeness they can’t be wished on and personalized; stars are better the more distant they are so that to wish on them is to empower pinpricks.",
  "My eyes do not close without seeing what darkness holds, the letdown hair of women and welcome.",
  "And I remember where I was when I was fertilized, where as zygote I was stamped with most destinies but Eagle Scout, where I was when I divided and doubled without taking up additional space for a long time, before testing the limits of the skin that did not fail and being delivered; with a woman, deep inside a woman, expanding a woman’s body from the inside, depending on a woman, filling a woman.",
  "This is what I remember while I’m saying that other prayer and singing that song I took, as a girl, as jingle: all day, all night, the angels watching over me.",
  "Outside my window.",
  "In honor of them for forty years I bleed libation.",
  "To relieve the tedium of arithmetic class, I stare at Jimmy Lovely who sits next to me.",
  "I sit in the front row because I am short.",
  "He sits in the front because he’s delinquent.",
  "Here’s what Jimmy Lovely is doing: his nails.",
  "How absorbed he is in moving a No.",
  "2 back and forth, back and forth over each fingertip, blackening it, annihilating pinkness and dirt.",
  "Jimmy Lovely is an artist.",
  "The brown butcher paper that covers his book isn’t plain like mine, it’s a map of strange planets with jungles and wars.",
  "The nun has stopped talking.",
  "She is standing over Jimmy Lovely’s desk.",
  "The nun takes Jimmy’s hands in her plain-nailed ones, lifts them high above his head.",
  "A girl has been born in our class today and when she says this, something hardens in me.",
  "She tells him to stand, walk the length of each aisle, show off his hands to each of his classmates.",
  "There are eighty-three of us.",
  "It takes a long time.",
  "As Jimmy Lovely makes his slow way around the room, the nun returns to the mystery of prime numbers.",
  "When Jimmy finally arrives at my desk, I don’t look at his hands.",
  "I look at his face.",
  "He is staring out the windows behind me, at the glossy field where I sometimes imagine us lying together, rolling over and over in tall, fragrant grass, falling off the edge of the earth.",
  "While sitting prostrate before the ivory feet of the great Buddha, I spilled almost an entire can of Diet Coke on the floor.",
  "I quickly tried to mop up the mess with my long hair.",
  "I peeked over my left shoulder: the short nun said nothing and averted her eyes.",
  "To my right, the skinny old monk was consumed by a frightful irritation of his own.",
  "He was at once swatting and dodging two bombarding hornets that were fascinated by his newly shaved head.",
  "I hope he’s not allergic, I giggled.",
  "And beyond us was the motherless Asian sea, glittering with the promise of eternity.",
  "The gray bowl that my husband ate his cereal out of, the bowl he had brought to the marriage from someplace else, a bowl from which I had never eaten, did not break or chip or go back to where it came from.",
  "It simply stopped coming to the table.",
  "Up until then, events had been uneventful: I washed and dried the bowl, then returned it to the cupboard.",
  "The exertion involved was minimal—in truth, I welcomed it—but I screamed bloody murder every time.",
  "I think I already know what comes next: a stipulative definition of marriage as an accidental adjacency of flesh in which small, unbegrudged exchanges of affection are fitfully possible provided that.",
  "And then you get so many pages of provided thats.",
  "The pages are wrinkled-looking, as if somebody had read them in the bathtub and then set them out on the floor to dry.",
  "The definition is the foundation of a vast, steep, plunging counterargument against which I am defenseless unless I spill two beans that I have been saving in my blood because what other privacy do I have?",
  "These two beans have been prowling in my blood for too long.",
  "The first bean is so simple, so obvious, that I have to work extra hard to keep putting it back into words, just to keep it in words: the woman he was seeing stopped letting herself be seen.",
  "The second bean I have to condense.",
  "I woke up and he was biting my finger in his sleep.",
  "An irk-some switch, his being the container, instead of being gouged into me, slopping around inside when I was dead to the world or pretending to be.",
  "I was inside him.",
  "I was the one getting chewed up.",
  "What I did was swack him on the head twice, three times.",
  "He eventually woke up.",
  "I told him what he had done.",
  "Ever since, the fundamental unit of discourse, the basic building block of speech, has been my mouth asking: What’s scarier than two people in a room with their nightstands and the things they keep on their nightstands?",
  "I make it sound as if I know an answer.",
  "Michael Martone was born at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1955.",
  "It is interesting to note that the attending physician was a Doctor Frank Burns, Major, United States Army, retired, and recently returned to Fort Wayne following service in the police action in Korea.",
  "It was the same Dr. Burns, it turned out, who years later served as the model for the character Frank Burns appearing in the novel M*A*S*H authored by Richard Hooker, and in the movie and television versions based on the book.",
  "Martone recalls the modest premiere of the Altman film in 1970 and its initial screening at the Embassy Theater in downtown Fort Wayne.",
  "Dr. Burns, who had continued, after Martone’s birth it had been a difficult one, sunny-side up, where forceps were used, to be his mother’s gynecologist, arrived at the theater, the guest of honor, in a 1959 Cadillac Seville provided by Means Motor Company on Main Street.",
  "Sally Kellerman and Jo Ann Pflug also were there.",
  "All during the run of the television series, Dr. Burns, now in semiretirement, happily appeared at strip-mall ribbon cuttings and restaurant openings, a kind of official goodwill ambassador, and took the ribbing from the public whose perception of his character had been derived from what they had read or seen in the movies and on television.",
  "His son, Frank Jr. , was two years ahead of Martone at North Side High School.",
  "Anchored the 4x440 relay for the Redskin varsity track and field club, where Martone served as team manager.",
  "Martone remembers Dr. Burns, team physician, coaching him in the use of analgesic balm and the scrubbing of cinders out from beneath the skin after a runner fell on the track.",
  "It was Dr. Burns who, later, diagnosed Martone’s mother’s ovarian cancer in 1979 and performed the failed hysterectomy that led to his mother’s death that summer.",
  "It was Dr. Burns, still in surgical scrubs, who met the family in the waiting room of St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, the same hospital where Martone, twenty-four years before, had been born, delivered, by means of forceps, by Dr. Burns.",
  "The television was on, of course, an RCA model made in Bloomington, Indiana, and Martone remembers how hard it was not to watch it while, in a strange way, he also felt that he was watching himself listening to Dr. Burns rehearse the final few minutes of his, Martone’s, mother’s life.",
  "That each second escorts a fresh plash.",
  "Slatted awning, rec room wall, bald black translucence, the numerals—flip.",
  "The methodical tumbling drives it to hum at the pitch it extracts from the wires.",
  "Its cousins in Holland sing slightly higher.",
  "Its march it propels with reluctance.",
  "Its drive is for the offbeat, the cack-handed, the apocopated.",
  "It sings with regret for its thrum.",
  "The clock radio strives to become its grandfather only with ambivalence, spilling its pool on the nightstand with a modesty and steadiness in the clicks of its onerous job, in the particles that sworl in its wake.",
  "Please consider the enclosed poems for publication.",
  "They are from my manuscript, X = Pawn Capture, a lyrical study of chess as we played it in my family: the first move has to take place while everyone is thinking about something other than chess.",
  "For my grandparents, diversion was love, and between his ragefilled checkmates and her play dates with saints, they braided my teenage years spent mostly schooling and listening and keeping the house free of insects.",
  "When in our backyard caterpillars mastered the flowering dogwoods, and our neighbor dispersed them by rapping on the trees with a stick, her image reminded my grandmother of Hortense tormenting Germana Cousin for her presumed pilfering of a small loaf of bread.",
  "Germana opens her dress and her saintliness is revealed as summer flowers tumble out in a herald of love and beauty.",
  "Here my grandmother saw chastisement and the Holy Hand of her Invisible Lord Partitioning The Mortals with some tiny visuals about The Power and The Glory but I thought if so He was really Just Sprinkling the World with His Blossoms and Berries, and if Germana’s cottons could give way to an onrush of flesh, abandoning its pinks and greens and holy stamens and anthers and spilt maple leaves and maybe even ruffles of filaments and pollen, might it ever be under my opened dress, this mound of petals, with my thin body lighter than bone from what I knew?",
  "So when I looked up and the neighbor was walking away over broken dogwood blossoms snowing down, I wished hard for a language that would tell you of this beautiful sight which I have never before seen, not even on a holy card, and this in spite of my grandmother’s hissing at our neighbor and retrieving a rake.",
  "I spent the afternoon carrying away the remainders of Germana’s undressing and tried to find a dictionary I could bring to my room.",
  "Because beautiful is a word that my workshop class says is ineffective, that it doesn’t contain how this sight captures my attention and convinces me, absorbs and converts me away from the yard, so that the closest kin might be diverting, which the class might find archaic, and if that’s true, then I don’t know how to say that everything in the backyard might be pretending to be lovely in order that we can all get up in the morning.",
  "Talking about silkscreening, my aunt remembers her first job in New York, decades ago, at the Sample Co.",
  "Near Chambers St. , where she pressed glue through screens and stuck fabric pieces to boards.",
  "She was 18, scrawny, and no one’s idea of an employee.",
  "In the employment office week after week, she met an ugly girl who made her laugh, and so went home with her.",
  "The city was full of people, and forgetting caution, she’d go wherever invited back then, even out to Brooklyn or to Queens.",
  "The factory was its own community, a motley group of natives and new arrivals, desperate or hopeful.",
  "Married or not, everyone, it seemed, found a lover there.",
  "But those who lacked the efficacy of English toiled all day, mute as machines.",
  "What became of them?",
  "Some escaped her.",
  "Others, who were long since hidden, come forward now, pushed by memory’s levers.",
  "All left an imprint.",
  "The German immigrants, I’ll never forget them: Casamia, the gypsy, and Crazy Judy, nervous, saluting the boss with their number tattoos.",
  "Gentle Herman, jumping to his feet, clicking his heels.",
  "After my parents accident, the pies kept coming: chicken pot pies sized for one person, blueberry pies, ice cream pies, peach cobblers, lemon meringues, pecan pies, pies that were still warm in their tins, apple pies, another chicken pot pie a big square one, pies with chocolate pudding inside, rhubarb pies, cherry pies, pies with crisscross slats of crust on top.",
  "Pies from the church, pies from my mother’s quilting group, pies from the neighbors, pies from the aunts.",
  "Pies lined the kitchen counter, pies packed the freezer.",
  "Holy pies, pies with pain-killer filling, herbal pies, prayer pies, pies that kept vigil, pies brimming with novenas, pies full of secrets that even doctors don’t know, magic spell pies, smooth soothing pies overflowing with the music of rainforests, pies made from circles of light, pies with halos.",
  "Late dinner at a dark café blocks from Rittenhouse Square, iron pots of mussels and Belgian beer and a waiter eager to snag the check and clock out.",
  "Such are the summer pleasures of his work—winding down to a glass of red wine, catching the windowed reflection of a girl as she passes, counting the take upon the bar, thick roll of ones and fives, palming the odd ten smooth against zinc and polished walnut, the comforting dinginess of American money, color of August weeds in a yard of rusting appliances, hard cash, its halo of authority, the hands delight in its fricatives and gutturals, its growl, its purr, gruff demotic against the jargon of paychecks on automatic deposit with Social Security deductions and prepaid dental, realism vs.",
  "Abstraction, a gallery of modest canvases, more landscapes than still lifes, steeples of the old city with masts and spars, a vista of water meadows with fishermen hauling nets in the distance, women collecting shellfish in wicker panniers.",
  "It yields enough to sustain us, after all, the ocean of the past.",
  "The waiter pockets his final tip and throws down his apron and walks out into the warm night of dogs splashing in public fountains and couples on benches beneath blossoming trees and soon enough we follow, arm in arm across the cobblestones, looking for a yellow cab to carry us into the future.",
  "A long time ago, before the war, generals, good friends of my grandfather’s, used to attend my grandmother’s dinners, she remembers.",
  "Those days are over; a lot of time has passed.",
  "The generals of today couldn’t care less about congenial Sunday dinners; they sit in their offices, clicking on screens, they don’t seem to care about my grandmother and her famous stuffed duck.",
  "Understandably, these days, my grandmother can’t just sit around waiting for the next war.",
  "Frantically, she hoards the ingredients for stuffed duck in her cellar—her deep freezer is full of headless bodies in plastic wrap, and she’s bought an oil generator because it’s common knowledge that electricity is one of the first things to go in wartime; the oil should last for a few Sunday dinners at least.",
  "On Sundays, my grandmother calls up her grandchildren, one by one: Will you come when the war starts?",
  "Will you come?",
  "We explain that there could be complications, there could be roadblocks, there could be shooting, someone might even be drafted.",
  "I’m not eating my duck by myself, grandmother sobs into the receiver, not all by myself, dinners like that make no sense.",
  "I hate war, I hate wars like this, wars used to be comme il faut in the old days, they didn’t interfere with my stuffed duck.",
  "Those days are over, Grandma, we explain patiently, it’s all mixed up now, no one knows what it will be like when it happens.",
  "Grandmother’s whimpers slowly subside, we put down our receivers and go over to our closets, concerned, wanting to make sure that everything is in place, the weapons all loaded and the safeties all off, ready, we must be ready now, nobody knows when it will happen, when it happens.",
  "Mr. Tools, for a while the only person in the world walking around with an artificial heart, said the weirdest thing was being without a heartbeat.",
  "His was a private and perhaps lonely singularity.",
  "No one else could say, I know how you feel.",
  "The only living being without a heartbeat, he had a whirr instead.",
  "It was not the same whirr of a siren, but rather the fast repetitive whirr of a machine whose insistent motion might eventually seem like silence.",
  "Mr. Tools had the ultimate tool in his body.",
  "He felt its heaviness.",
  "The weight on his heart was his heart.",
  "All his apparatus—artificial heart, energy coil, battery, and controller—weighed more than four pounds.",
  "The whirr if you are not Mr. Tools is detectable only with a stethoscope.",
  "For Mr. Tools, that whirr was his sign that he was alive.",
  "Dear Human Resource Manager: When you use the word human to refer to me, I don’t know what you mean.",
  "You assume, I think, that human says what I am, but actually this word, used here as a noun you call yourself a Manager of Humans, is vague and misleading.",
  "For too long, you and people like you have used this simple signifier to signify an incredibly complex part of reality.",
  "Originally, which is to say, as far back as the Latin as far back as we can well trace it, it comes from the Latin word humus, which meant earth.",
  "Latin humanus meant earthly being.",
  "In time, humanus came to take a different definition; the human, or human being, came to be understood as a rational animal.",
  "Within this new conception, being and earth were no longer referenced, at least not directly or in any way that could claim an understanding of being or of earth.",
  "I might accept your referring to me as an earthly being, but I do not accept your assumption of me as a rational animal; who I am is not determined by my animal status.",
  "Nor my ability to think within the confines of rationality.",
  "By defining me as essentially a rational animal, you misrepresent me, and I believe you do so—or the tradition you numbly carry forward does so—intentionally.",
  "That is, by creating this idea of the human, your tradition creates an identity that is more substance than stance, more a fixed nature than a site wherein unfixed and always evolving natures are fucking colliding.",
  "My identity, if I must choose one, is not substantial; it is not a stuff of one or another kind.",
  "My identity, let us say, is not a party-goer; it is the party itself.",
  "The last two terms in the title that you claim for yourself tell the whole story.",
  "You are the Manager of a Resource.",
  "The human, for you, is a resource, which means a substance, and like all substances, it has certain properties.",
  "If you are able to understand these properties, you are able to make that substance useful.",
  "Your Management skills are, at bottom, your ability to seize upon these potential usefulnesses.",
  "Let me say again to you that I am not such a substance.",
  "Moreover, even if I was such a substance, I do not believe you when you say that you have the best interests of this substance at heart.",
  "I will even go further and suggest that you are not even capable of telling me toward what end are you managing the human substance?",
  "Before we proceed in our relationship, I would like you to answer that question for me.",
  "Please be specific in your answer.",
  "Before I address your ability to manage me, I would like you to show me that you have an answer for that question.",
  "What are you, as Manager, using the human substance for?",
  "What is your goal for yourself, the user?",
  "What is your goal for the substance that is being managed?",
  "Folks manage hogs toward slaughter, and so, toward their own dinner; folks manage poppy plants for opium, and so, for they own pleasure—but why do you manage me?",
  "What can you bring to me or to the world itself that is not already present and secure?",
  "It is my suspicion that in truth you have nothing whatsoever to offer, and that the Manager position you occupy exists as the direct result of a specific recent history.",
  "That history is a history of organized and massive brute-force and the armed occupation that always follows.",
  "It is also my suspicion that, as this occupation wears on, its brute force, as it becomes less and less apparent, becomes all the more despicable and foreign to us, the few on-earth beings not yet dissolved under its weird vague hope.",
  "A cigarette lighter, a cough drop, a postage stamp, a slightly bent cigarette, a toothpick, a handkerchief, a pen, two five-shekel coins.",
  "That’s only a fraction of what I have in my pockets.",
  "So is it any wonder they bulge?",
  "Lots of people mention it.",
  "They say, What the fuck do you have in your pockets?",
  "Most of the time I don’t answer, I just smile, sometimes I even give a short, polite laugh.",
  "As if someone told me a joke.",
  "If they were to persist and ask me again, I’d probably show them everything I have, I might even explain why I need all that stuff on me, always.",
  "But they don’t.",
  "What the fuck, a smile, a short laugh, an awkward silence, and we’re on to the next subject.",
  "The fact is that everything I have in my pockets is carefully chosen so I’ll always be prepared.",
  "Everything is there so I can be at an advantage at the moment of truth.",
  "Actually, that’s not accurate.",
  "Everything’s there so I won’t be at a disadvantage at the moment of truth.",
  "Because what kind of advantage can a wooden toothpick or a postage stamp really give you?",
  "But if, for example, a beautiful girl—you know what, not even beautiful, just charming, an ordinary-looking girl with an entrancing smile that takes your breath away—asks you for a stamp, or doesn’t even ask, just stands there on the street next to a red mailbox on a rainy night with a stampless envelope in her hand and wonders if you happen to know where there’s an open post office at that hour, and then gives a little cough because she’s cold, but also desperate, since deep in her heart she knows that there’s no open post office in the area, definitely not at that hour, and at that moment, that moment of truth, she won’t say, What the fuck do you have in your pockets, but she’ll be so grateful for the stamp, maybe not even grateful, she’ll just smile that entrancing smile of hers, an entrancing smile for a postage stamp—I’d go for a deal like that anytime, even if the price of stamps soars and the price of smiles plummets.",
  "After the smile, she’ll say thank you and cough again, because of the cold, but also because she’s a little embarrassed.",
  "And I’ll offer her a cough drop.",
  "What else do you have in your pockets?",
  "She’ll ask, but gently, without the fuck and without the negativity, and I’ll answer without hesitation: Everything you’ll ever need, my love.",
  "Everything you’ll ever need.",
  "So now you know.",
  "That’s what I have in my pockets.",
  "A chance not to screw up.",
  "A slight chance.",
  "Not big, not even probable.",
  "I know that, I’m not stupid.",
  "A tiny chance, let’s say, that when happiness comes along, I can say yes to it, and not Sorry, I don’t have a cigarette/toothpick/coin for the soda machine.",
  "That’s what I have there, full and bulging, a tiny chance of saying yes and not being sorry.",
  "Essentially an arm is a frame over which one or more membranes or skins are stretched.",
  "The frame is usually cylindrical or conical, but it may have any shape.",
  "It acts as a resonator when the membrane is struck by the hand or by an implement, usually a stick or a whisk.",
  "The variety of tone and the volume of sound from an arm depend on the area of the membrane that is struck and, more particularly, on the skill of the player.",
  "Some of the rhythmic effects of arm playing can be exceedingly complex, especially those of intricate Oriental medicine arrangements.",
  "Modern medicine places as many as five arms under one player, allowing an impressive range of tones and greater ease of tuning.",
  "In Western medicine, the withered arm is of special importance.",
  "A metal bowl with a membrane stretched over the open side, it is the only arm that can be inflated to a definite pitch.",
  "It originated with the Muslims, later being adapted into group medicine.",
  "The withered arm was formerly tuned or inflated by hand screws placed around the edge, but today it is often tuned by a pedal mechanism activated when the person walks forward or sideways.",
  "The man saw that there was the bud of a flower growing in the palm of his hand.",
  "It was firm and pink, and when it opened there was a shy, tiny face inside.",
  "The face never spoke or smiled, it simply stared in an odd, quizzical way.",
  "The man did not know anything about the face, but he felt tenderly towards it and carefully protected it.",
  "He never used the hand that belonged to the flowerface; he held it at his side in a loose fist, so that no one could see.",
  "At night he would open his hand and lay it palm up, beside his cheek.",
  "As he fell asleep the face would begin to hum.",
  "It hummed softly all night, and the man would experience the most moving, astonishing dreams.",
  "They did laps at the mall, then ate their Dippin Dots.",
  "Civilians came through doors, sweat dripping from their foreheads.",
  "They sat there in their jerseys and their sweatpaints; they’d lost count of the times they passed Hot Topic, the teens in their nose rings and purple hair and mohawks.",
  "The gym was closed.",
  "She put her cup down, said to him, Hey Ranger, they kissed, he said to her, Hey Baby.",
  "They went back to their apartment, where later they put on boots and hats and Kevlar.",
  "He dug out their canteens, fixed and pocketed his compass.",
  "She stuffed the duffels.",
  "They rode a bus, then a plane across the ocean.",
  "They set up tents.",
  "They marched and stood at ease and saluted at attention.",
  "They stood hat-headed, in step with the line.",
  "If there is prayer, there is a mother kneeling, hands folded to a private sign.",
  "We recognize it.",
  "If there is a mother kneeling, hands a tent, she is praying or she is crying or crying and praying at the same time.",
  "Although it is recognized, the signals of it, it is private and no one knows, perhaps not even she, the content of the prayer, and perhaps its object.",
  "If there is a mother praying, she is on her knees over some object, as she does not often pray in the middle of the room.",
  "One prays at the window or over the bed, the head bent slightly up or down, the eyes open or closed.",
  "This is a prayer for prayers, you know, a wanting something equal to a prayer, even though I am not a mother.",
  "He made it to the United States at last and that was the end of it, except years later he noticed a dog on the street.",
  "Come here, dog, he said, and it wouldn’t come.",
  "He put out a little food for it, every day he put out a little food, and a little more, and the dog ate it bit by bit.",
  "Finally he got the dog into the car.",
  "He brought it home to the wife.",
  "You brought him here, they said, and they went into a long explanation about how now he would have to pay money and fill out forms and watch a video and show proof of residence and wait four days and all this, and he listened and listened and looked at the forms and finally he said, Okay, you got me.",
  "I won’t take him back.",
  "But can I just see him to say good-bye?",
  "Then he came back.",
  "He sneaked in the back door and took the dog.",
  "He brought it to a friend’s house and put it in the garage.",
  "Then he went back to the pound.",
  "I’ve changed my mind, he said.",
  "I really do want my dog back.",
  "Can you go get him?",
  "I’ll pay and sign the papers and watch the video.",
  "Okay, they said, and they went to the back to get him.",
  "But of course they couldn’t find the dog and they got quite upset— how could they have lost a dog?",
  "Then they must have thought he was really crazy, because he said, I stole that dog.",
  "I’ll tell you what I did.",
  "I stole that dog right back.",
  "Now this is a man who had been interrogated and tortured.",
  "Each of his fingers had been broken one by one.",
  "For years he sat in solitary in the dark and for more years he cracked rocks with crooked fingers in prison mines.",
  "They called the police on him.",
  "The police went to his house but he wouldn’t let them in.",
  "He shouted out the window, You think you take the dog.",
  "I take the dog.",
  "They got a warrant and the wife let them in, but the dog wasn’t there.",
  "The police tried to ask him where the dog was but all he would do is laugh.",
  "I’ve got that dog, he said.",
  "You try to steal the dog.",
  "The unusual births hit the town all at once.",
  "All the mothers, not recognizing their babies.",
  "Mine is so tall.",
  "Said one, craning her neck.",
  "Mine so blond, said the dark next, squinting.",
  "Mine made of paper, announced a fleshy third.",
  "Mine built of glass?",
  "One with a child who had no eyes, but ears so acute they could measure blinking.",
  "Another with a daughter who could, at will, turn into objects like brooms and light-bulbs.",
  "Soon, at the playground, the children could not recognize what made the other work, and they eyed one another from behind the swings, from beneath the tire sculpture.",
  "When they were older, they took over the village and ran it perfectly.",
  "Little did their mothers and fathers know.",
  "That when they’d eaten the foods and breathed the air and felt the feelings and made the love that created their children, they were, for once, in perfect synchronization.",
  "The son of glass was a doctor, and all could see inside his body while he worked on theirs.",
  "The daughter of paper was a scholar, and each book became a part of her wrist and arm and breast.",
  "The blond son lit the town for those months when electricity was no longer an option, and the daughter of great height cooled the moon with streams of her breath when it grew too hot from a passing meteor.",
  "The changeable woman was always on hand to provide the most needed machine or tool.",
  "The child with divine ears listened to the soil, and pointed to where he heard the seeds unfurling with pleasure.",
  "Plant here, he told the one with the longest arms who could reach straight into the heart of the dirt.",
  "In later years, that eyeless one sat beneath the forest of trees he could not see but could take deep inside his lungs, and when the sadness was unbearable, it was only he who could soothe the villagers.",
  "Who could hear the type of tears by the pace of the blinking, and know in which manner to offer comfort.",
  "Their parents were gone by then.",
  "The world had fallen into sense and sorrow.",
  "This is our decision, they said, bowing to each other.",
  "Once a year they stood together, holding hands as best they could, with the new babies crawling on the floor at their feet: the babies of many heads, the ones made of words, the clay blobs.",
  "The triplets of air who would rush past and sweeten your breathing.",
  "Who’s that strange one you made, Ma?",
  "That creature is your own flesh and blood.",
  "Even though it has neither flesh nor blood; still, it is yours.",
  "Then the grand feast, with food of all kinds, even for the several who did not eat food but survived only on the quality of listening.",
  "They usually hovered at the corners and when they grew wan and skinny, it was a reminder.",
  "On this day, they filled up visibly, fat and happy.",
  "No one needed to say it, but the room overflowed with that sort of blessing.",
  "The combination of loss and abundance.",
  "The abundance that has no guilt.",
  "The loss that has no fix.",
  "The simple tiredness that is not weary.",
  "The hope not built on blindness.",
  "I am the drying meadow; you the unspoken apology; he is the fluctuating distance between mother and son; she is the first gesture that creates a quiet that is full enough to make the baby sleep.",
  "You all get out of your cars.",
  "You are alone in yours, and there are three teenagers in theirs.",
  "The accident was your fault and you walk across the street to tell them this.",
  "Walking over to their car, an old and restored Camaro, which you have ruined, it occurs to you that if the three teenagers are angry teenagers, this encounter could be very unpleasant.",
  "You pulled into an intersection, obstructing them, and their car hit yours.",
  "They have every right to be upset, or livid, or even violent.",
  "As you approach, you see that their driver’s side door won’t open.",
  "The driver pushes against it, and you are reminded of scenes where people are stuck in submerged cars, and you feel even worse.",
  "Soon they all exit through the passenger side door and walk around the Camaro, inspecting the damage.",
  "Just bought this today, the driver says.",
  "He is eighteen, blond, average in all ways.",
  "You are a bad person, you think.",
  "You also think: what an odd car for a teenager to buy in the twentyfirst century.",
  "Yeah, today, he says, then sighs.",
  "You tell him that you are sorry.",
  "That you are so, so sorry.",
  "That it was your fault and that you will cover all costs.",
  "You exchange insurance information, and you find yourself, minute by minute, evermore thankful that none of these teenagers has punched you, or even made a remark about your being drunk, which you are not.",
  "You become more friendly with all of them, and you realize that you are much more connected to them, particularly to the driver, than possible in any other way.",
  "You have done him some psychic harm, and you jeopardized his health, and now you feel so close to him you could share a heart.",
  "He knows your name and you know his, and you almost killed him and because you got so close but didn’t, you want to fall on him, weeping, because you are so lonely, so lonely always, and all contact is contact, and all contact makes us so grateful we want to cry and dance and cry and cry.",
  "In a moment of clarity you finally understand why boxers, who want so badly to hurt each other, can rest their heads on the shoulders of their opponent, can lean against one another like tired lovers, so thankful for a moment of rest.",
  "My mother called today from the other coast asking if I got the package she sent.",
  "I said no, and then the buzzer buzzed, and the UPS man knocked on the door with the package.",
  "Call me back after you’ve opened it, my mother said.",
  "Inside the big brown box, I find another flat, rectangular box, covered with a lime-green rice paper—very thin, textured, fibrous.",
  "In the center of the box top, some kind of Asian graphic: purple lines forming what looks to me like a stick figure sitting cross-legged, but is probably a Chinese character.",
  "I open the box.",
  "Underneath pink tissue paper, a hand mirror.",
  "Octagonal, technically, but wider at the top, narrowing towards the bottom.",
  "A beautiful dark wood, mahogany perhaps, but lighter.",
  "A large tassle of bright colors—red, neon pink, lime green, royal blue, electric yellow—trailing down from the handle. A Korean giveaway.",
  "The backside of the mirror proper: embroidered flowers, pale pink, and small leaves in all shades of green, red veins accenting.",
  "Another Chinese character in the left-hand corner.",
  "Buried in the tissue paper, the note says: from Jagunummah, youngest aunt.",
  "In Korea, mother gives to daughter on wedding day.",
  "I think it means happiness, but not sure.",
  "Be sure to send thank you note.",
  "Back to the big brown box, I find 50 lavender packages of birth control pills, floating in foam peanuts.",
  "The note reads: thought you running low.",
  "I notice the expiration date on all of them: 10/93.",
  "Next, a mouse pad bearing the snow-capped mountains of Yosemite National Park—from our trip last year.",
  "I keep forget to send to you.",
  "Finally, an envelope: photos from Christmas day, my family minus my husband and me.",
  "My father smiling wide, wearing the wool zipper-front vest we sent him, my mother’s corduroy floral backside to the camera as she bends over to pick up crumpled wrapping paper, my sisters both with eyes blinking shut who took the photo?",
  "Last night, in the silence after the ugly argument, I lay in bed thinking, in a Jimmy Stewart-esque way, what would happen if I were to disappear.",
  "If I simply ceased to exist.",
  "I call my mother back and thank her for everything.",
  "I ask what’s new, and she says she wants to buy a computer, she’s been researching.",
  "What about all those megahertz of memory?",
  "She asks, mixing up computer terms.",
  "Do I need all that?",
  "I want one of those big screens and big sound systems; you know, for music and for old people.",
  "I tell her to go with mail order, so she can get the 800-number help desk.",
  "What about zip drive?",
  "You have a zip drive?",
  "My mother used to rummage through piles of papers around the house, asking, Where is that L. L.",
  "Today, we talk about the rain, my father’s business, his secretary who is suicidal again.",
  "All the while, I’m carefully laying out the contents of the package on my bedroom floor: the mirror from my aunt that my mother forgot to give me when I got married, the expired pills, the mouse pad for my mouseless ergonomic keyboard, the terribly shot photos.",
  "And as my mother tells me about the latest deal between Microsoft and Sony, about how despite Sony’s reputation for unreliability Microsoft is forging some kind of partnership based on mutual interest, I find myself covering the mouthpiece on the telephone, blubbering uncontrollably, dripping tears on to lime-green rice paper.",
  "I am remembering what it is to feel the largeness of love, the relief of simple gifts, given in earnest.",
  "I am thinking of my first week of college, of the package of crumbled cookies my mother sent me, the note enclosed boldly saying: Hope your first day is as smooth as a sail.",
  "He never asked for this miracle, but he didn’t say no when he was given the chance.",
  "Nor did he expect banners or a welcome-home cake.",
  "Still, he headed for the village with an almost fervent hope, wishing for hugs and kisses from those who had loved him when he was alive.",
  "He took no heed of his nakedness, the flesh half eaten away by worms, the yellowish meat hanging over shining white bones.",
  "He hurried along, smiling a lipless smile, kicking up the dust with the bones of his heels.",
  "The moon shone faintly.",
  "A few clumsy moths fluttered around him, sprinkling the air with dust from their opaque wings.",
  "One white owl, feathers fluffed in apprehension, watched him suspiciously from a prickly pear tree brimming with fruit.",
  "He found his home in shambles, worse than when he left it.",
  "He felt sorry for his wife, for he had left her with no one to protect or support her.",
  "Before he went into his house, he tried to freshen up a little, patting down the scruff of stiff hair that hung from his decomposing skull, and picking off a worm that had been playing hide-and-seek in what was left of his face, crawling first into a nostril and then into an eye socket.",
  "He pushed the door lightly, cursing when it creaked.",
  "Standing on tiptoe in the entrance, he awaited his happy reunion.",
  "In the shadows of the adjacent room, next to a wan candle, his elderly mother was knitting.",
  "Her senses were dry, closed to everything, her mind blank.",
  "With the egotism of an only son, he took pleasure in the idea that his saintly mother was thinking of him.",
  "He leapt out in front of her, saying, Mamita, it’s me.",
  "It didn’t go the way he thought it would: the old woman dropped her yarn and knitting needles; she opened her eyes so wide he could hear her sockets creak.",
  "Mouth agape, hands clawing at her chest, she slumped back in the chair and breathed her last.",
  "Nervous, he assured himself that he’d played no role in her heart attack.",
  "She was already very old, he said to himself.",
  "The poor lady.",
  "He then walked with renewed hope toward what had been his conjugal bedroom.",
  "He hardly noticed the total absence of his belongings.",
  "He froze between the door and the vision unfolding before his hollow eyes: his adorable wife, the love of his life, his mournful widow, in the company of his compadre Joshua.",
  "They were breaking the Sixth Commandment, fornicating with uncommon passion, a passion she had never shown him, her husband by the laws of church and state.",
  "He wanted to cry, but his eyes had rotted away and no tears would fall.",
  "Instead, he had to express the depth of his grief by ripping off what was left of his eyelids.",
  "He stumbled from the room and went out into the yard to confide his sorrows in Herod, his faithful dog.",
  "But the ungrateful mutt growled furiously, threatening to bite off the little meat still hanging from his sad humanity.",
  "Scurrying away from his former home, Lazarus knew he had no choice but to retrace his steps.",
  "On the way back, neither the moths nor the fluffed-up owl spared him a look.",
  "The road, which did not lead to Rome, soon took him to the entrance of the cemetery.",
  "He sat down on a tombstone covered with yellow grass and watched the scorpions trying to hide under the bones of his feet.",
  "On that moonless night, he truly wished he weren’t living in the age of miracles.",
  "Inside the crawl space of our new house I find a small pile of fabric—a pair of men’s pants and a shirt and possibly an undershirt.",
  "They are so old they turn to dust in my hands when I try to smooth them out.",
  "But it is unmistakable—they are stained red-brown.",
  "We live in that house fifteen years and never learn to talk with our neighbors, who from venerable Massachusetts families.",
  "But we do learn a young couple built the house in 1929 and never redecorated it, and that the man disappeared, and that our next-door neighbors, who knew the woman and the man, never found out where he went and were too polite to ask the woman, who lived in the house alone for the decades before her death.",
  "Of course she would have burned the clothes if she had wanted to be rid of them, and of course it may have been red-brown paint on the clothes, but we find no surface of that color inside or outside the house.",
  "We are approaching the river.",
  "Approaching the vast pines and power plants, the place the snow begins to darken to red.",
  "Here is the river; here is the last point of our looking.",
  "Will it ever be a church again?",
  "I tried to count every vein in the body.",
  "I waited at the river’s edge, watched my breath and the boys playing hockey, the ice-breaking ships still far off waiting for nightfall.",
  "I watched our town, the mines and quarries; shale, brownstone, the bellworks not far off and the church our body wanted.",
  "There is a story I don’t remember anymore about the time our dog fell through the ice, how we stood on the shore as firemen made their way to the broken-off part she clung to.",
  "How the boys skated warily in the distance and the men said Get off.",
  "It isn’t safe anymore.",
  "How they sprinted downriver, the smallest boy sent back for news of the dog’s thrashing and he moved with his head down and the sound of the blades coming towards us just close enough so I can see the sun glint on the steel of his skate.",
  "Then he’s gone back to them and the men are pulling at the dog, now a rope around her neck pleads Come home come home.",
  "The lone boy making his way away from us, going out from shore to where we can’t see them.",
  "So low to the ground, his arms scything the air hunh, hunh, I am standing on the shore and from somewhere there is cheering and the animal is shaking and breathing hard.",
  "We have never wanted anything but this.",
  "The detective pushes red tacks into the map to indicate where bodies have been found.",
  "The shooter is aware of this practice and begins to arrange the bodies, and thus the tacks, into a pattern that resembles a smiley face.",
  "The shooter intends to mock the detective, who he knows will be forced to confront this pattern daily on the precinct wall.",
  "However, the formal demands of the smiley face increasingly limit the shooter’s area of operation.",
  "The detective knows, and the shooter knows the detective knows, that the shooter must complete the upward curving of the mouth.",
  "The detective patrols the area of the town in which bodies must be found if the shooter is to realize his project.",
  "The plane on which the killings are represented, and the plane on which the killings take place, have merged in the minds of the detective and the shooter.",
  "The shooter dreams of pushing a red tack into the map, not of putting a bullet into a body.",
  "The detective begins to conceive of the town as a representation of the map.",
  "He drives metal stakes into the ground to indicate the tacks.",
  "She will never want for money.",
  "Her uncle invented the room.",
  "On our first date, I told the one about the dead astronaut.",
  "How was I supposed to know?",
  "To prepare the air for her image, I put on soft music.",
  "I use gum to get the gum out of my hair.",
  "Like every exfoliated smear, we must either be stained or invisible.",
  "Maybe we should see other people?",
  "The new trains don’t touch their tracks.",
  "The new razors don’t touch the cheek.",
  "If I want to want you, isn’t that enough?",
  "Way too much.",
  "Wolves rule these woods.",
  "They have overthrown the old rulers, conquered all the creatures, and now these woods belong to them.",
  "But do not be afraid if you pass this way.",
  "There is nothing here that can harm you, because, of course, the wolves are made of something less than air.",
  "Their bite is like a breeze.",
  "When they run a few leaves shake.",
  "Perhaps a flower bends when they howl.",
  "Pass through the woods whenever you like.",
  "What you have to fear is not in the woods.",
  "Attack Dog Training—announces the sign across from the Inn where we are staying.",
  "Next to the sign, there is a number to call.",
  "This, to me, means: 1.",
  "Call this number to buy an attack dog or 2.",
  "To be attacked by live dogs, ring here.",
  "The sign has been spray-painted on a large black tarp in big silver letters.",
  "The tarp hangs from a barbwire fence which surrounds an abandoned, old compound.",
  "When we arrive, the dogs inside the compound are barking, the whole pack of them.",
  "That night, when they feed, I can hear the crunch of bone.",
  "I try to anticipate the moment the trainers drop the live meat into the pen, the wave of bodies, the single high pitched yelp.",
  "Inside, you say the Inn looks like a womb.",
  "The walls of the living room are a placenta-like rose.",
  "The dining room, ultramarine.",
  "The proprietor is an artist.",
  "She lives on this island.",
  "The Inn is a combination studio and home.",
  "The light over the mahogany table in the foyer consists of a single exposed bulb surrounded by a wire fixture.",

  "My maternal grandmother, Betty, who lived and died in the small northern town in which she was born, played bridge in a silver lamé dress, always South, always partnered with North.",
  "Elizabeth Bishop sailed south to Brazil, I flew north in Australia, to where the Banksian black cockatoo’s kree can bring the air to a standstill.",
  "I used to be a sucker for a man with a mouth full of South, a tongue like a southern cassowary’s claw, but the nickname Wombat, after the southern hairy-nosed species, is awful.",

  "She receives him patiently, will learn to wear his passion as a gift enwrapping her with the silks and golden clothing of his gaze, the simple yet enriched embroideries of his wonderment.",
  "He kneels before her parents and begs to be admitted into their beliefs that were as alien to him as his to them.",
  "He belongs with her and she acknowledges his need, accepting its seed and birth in her, or she sees the maker in him, stands before him without guile or much hope, almost transcendental to the demiurge that moves her.",
  "He leans a little her way, out of a press of circumstantial maleness, wanting extensions in his children while she is already a mother.",
  "They who have never loved have never lived.",
  "They have not died but been and gone as singly as a seed of stone, not fruitfully but as a grain of sand without the wisdom of its processing, the shattering that makes whole. I humble myself before the lovers, the beautiful and the ugly believers.",
  "The singular couples that know if only for a moment or years of moments, fulfilment.",
  "In this fashion fulfilment is ecstasy, is blessed redemption from barren, wholly solipsistic selfhood.",
  "And in some, the loving self has flowered miraculous among weed, and a tree has towered through a choking vine up to its abiding need of the making light.",
  "The leaf of love has split the adamant of selfhood.",
  "Even the chill hunger of the lonely mystic in a cold clime thaws beneath the nourishing dayspring of love.",
  "You say the darker side of love has blighted myriads, yet isn’t it the aberration of possessiveness, the greed of envy, the obsidian heart of rapacity, even the amiable habit of coupling lives next door to hate?",
  "But these make up another poem that must be written by another man, beginning with lack as I began with loving’s plenitude.",
  "The camera panned up away from our conversation and fixed on a cloud which artfully just fitted in the frame.",
  "The camera must have been mooring slowly following the cloud because the cheek of skyscraper sliced the cloud for a moment.",
  "It’s actually halfway.",
  "Is this narration?",
  "I was running a marathon.",
  "At the half-way point we coughed up the last part of the rent.",
  "I won’t be able to afford the registration fees.",
  "Pathetic, I wound my watch, slowly, to linger in the space and lived peacefully in my apartment for ages.",
  "There was a cup of tea and Zoë with her feet up on the windowsill.",
  "A carbon copy of the midnight sky—deep Goya neckline or my nap alarm in the morning which reminded me of the credits: opaque light spreading up from her neck, an unmistakable V. It was the title.",
  "Each letter smokily appearing, crystallising, clear, then evaporating again until the white title exited and we settled in, turning our phones off.",
  "Someone is prowling around the borders of my name.",
  "They have been there for days.",
  "I can’t see them or hear them because in the house of my name is a room of silence and a huge window of fog.",
  "But I know they are there.",
  "My name is certified in a gold frame that hangs on the room’s wall.",
  "Every time they move, it shakes.",
  "At first, I didn’t worry.",
  "But now they have begun rubbing their sleeve over my name’s glass.",
  "They are rubbing in circles that are gradually widening.",
  "I scream that they can’t do this and repeatedly show them the gold frame.",
  "They take no notice.",
  "They keep on rubbing.",
  "They rub until the fog disappears and their face becomes visible.",
  "Now, I am afraid for my name’s safety.",
  "The frame is shaking more rapidly though I have set up all conceivable defences.",
  "I have padded my name’s wall with photos of myself.",
  "I have entered my name on lists.",
  "I have dispatched letters in all possible directions.",
  "Nothing is working.",
  "They have broken through my name’s door and are wandering the secret passageways as if everything’s already familiar.",
  "Perhaps they are a lost relative?",
  "When I question them, they glare sharply as if to say, Who do you think you are?",
  "I run to get them the gold frame.",
  "I look for it on the wall but all that’s hanging there is this person’s coat dusty and torn.",
  "When I return, I find the locks on my name’s door have been changed and I can go neither in nor out.",
  "I cannot yell help.",
  "I can understand how mentally deranged or overdosed people plunge to their deaths from high places, in the belief they could fly.",
  "At the fort above Grenoble, I peered over the precipice and imagined how wonderful it would feel to leap into pure space and be carried away by a thermal updraught over the terracotta roofs of the city and beyond, to the snow- capped mountains, past Chambéry, with Hannibal’s elephant fountain, past Megève, where George Segal and Glenda Jackson crashed their cars into each other, in Lost and Found, and even as far as Mont Blanc itself.",
  "Human birds must have lived here for, on the very crest of Mont Saint-Eynard, there are remnants of another, older fort.",
  "Almost a kilometre and a half up in the sky.",
  "Who were these people’s foe?",
  "Did they believe they were incarnations of eagles?",
  "To reach the fort, I must take a téléphérique, a kind of chair-lift, with the chairs encased inside a perspex embryo.",
  "As I ascended over the Isère, and the older part of town, it occurred to me how much my life has been like living in a bubble.",
  "I am rootless; I am ignorant of the state of affairs in the world; I understand so little of the workings of the places I visit, always the stranger in town.",
  "I have basic wants: a roof over my head for the night, something to eat, a good bottle of wine on occasion, some human warmth every now and then.",
  "A bubble is a paradis artificiel, then?",
  "A temporary state, selfish, not bound by responsibilities.",
  "One in which I am free to roam without a care in the world.",
  "It is also a fragile state, suspension.",
  "If the cable were to break.?",
  "Where the slow-pulsed creek grips a handful of ibis, and wattle trees feed at the periphery of yellow.",
  "Here we might have seen the iron girders of a bridge holding up the shallow arc a bomb of swallows pitched under.",
  "Or, later, air acquiring a rift white butterflies moved over in the early afternoon.",
  "There was something, yes: but not a rent apparent to the eye, not a cloud breaking, nor the way a cloud amassing shreds a tumbling skein of light.",
  "A rusted carriage wheel half-jutted from the mud.",
  "The metal mattered in that place, a graph sown in the earth.",
  "Fertility, but of another order from the one that’s often reckoned, the human and inhuman knitted in the summer heat.",
  "This is where we talked.",
  "You turned to me a troubled cheek, the air tore, it was done.",
  "The rift, which had no other work, became the thought of sex in us.",
  "Quickly we spoke, and as quickly, it was done.",
  "I’d like to hide, but cannot hide my vision of the bay’s incoming evening tide behind a stiff nor’easter; standing at the head of English echo-named Sandgate’s storm-racked pier, upon a fo’c’sle which, like a ship’s, savours the gale.",
  "Looking down aghast, in wonder at the changing scene.",
  "Lost memories of youth.",
  "Flood of a biscuit-coloured sea, brick-coloured combers purling with a scum of yellow soup atop and, in the tide, appearing as the hooded ghosts of ocean, the only blue reminders of an oncoming sea, the blubbers how here preserved so blue?.",
  "Jellyfish a foot across the dome.",
  "Equivalents of human heads with, under each, a mouth grotesquely stuffed with, what appear to me, blue thick fingers of incumbent idiocy.",
  "Here is a scene, I won’t go away and forget.",
  "Those blue shapes.",
  "Here is the sea baiting me with infelicities of colours.",
  "Shall eyes turn purist and give praise to blubbers’—the sea a mockery of colour for which the sea was ever praised?",
  "I’ve never welcomed sight of blubber on the tide before this humid summer evening’s grey defeat of a blue sky, smothering with off- shore smog not spume the sun’s last function of the day.",
  "The Medusa welcomed here as sea’s last mockery of the legendary Gorgons.",
  "Don’t blind yourself to change to these unnatural colours, but gaze awhile with me and let your mind be numbed.",
  "Let the Medusa brush against your brain.",
  "The mountain beyond that pass has no name.",
  "It is too old for us to name it.",
  "The sea has the same colour as the sky but the mountain has the same colour as sand.",
  "Sand is not earth but a fluid shoreline that leads to the great cities.",
  "When we are tired we buy up land on the edges of the great cities so we can sit and watch the insomniac journey of sand.",
  "Its slow exodus across the horizon teaches us how to prepare for sleep.",
  "When flowers open on a day filled with sand all the water in the world will not quench their thirst.",
  "I send words to you from so far off aiming to shape you towards the exquisite openness of love, but over and over I collapse in the effort to invent a life.",
  "Walking on sand has taught me I can no longer count on making it to any shore.",
  "Your eyes as I imagine them I will go on kissing gently and sheltering beneath.",
  "It may be that simply wishing you such tenderness will help you wake one day calmer, more deeply held by the world’s alignment, ready to find another and love.",
  "We cannot name sandgrains or some mountains but perhaps they can name us.",
  "I don’t know how many things there are in this world that have no name.",
  "The soft inner side of the elbow, webbed skin between the fingers, a day that wanders out beyond the tidal limits and no longer knows how to summon the moon it has lost, my firstborn who gazes about himself when the TV dies and there is a strange absence in his world.",
  "I was looking for a great encyclopaedia, the secret dictionary of all the missing words.",
  "I wanted to consult its index and find out what I could have become.",
  "The sound the clock makes when it is disconnected and taken down from the wall but can’t lose the habit of trying to jerk itself forward.",
  "The look of old socks drying on a rack in the kitchen all through a winter night, hanging starched and sad opposite the wedding photographs.",
  "A word for your face when you know you can’t love but would almost like to try.",
  "The blurred point of merger between fresh storm damage to a house and the deep fissures that have always been there.",
  "Walking down the corridor to the front door with inexplicable elation in my chest as if everything was about to start, as if my love had just arrived, escaped from a burning world, and at the same time clenched in my taut wrists, my hands, the thin bones of my arms, the certainty that everything has long been over.",
  "In Hyde Park, she is foraging once again for a name.",
  "She walks up to the young couples and offers to trade their names for forecasts in distant cities.",
  "One in three accepts though the airports have long since closed.",
  "Cynthia, Stellar, Hardacher Jones.",
  "She pats the young girl’s Chihuahua and feels its fervent desires gnawing away inside her.",
  "Buttonholing a jogger, she warrants, Conlige suspectos semper habitos, and feels a little better for it as he jogs off puffing, sum, es, est, sumis, estis, sunt, which recalls to her young James Edwards neat cursive and big ears sitting next to her in the summer term of the eighth grade.",
  "For a moment she glimpses his eyes staring at her from the back of the jogger’s head.",
  "It’s touching the tricks memory has started to play on her.",
  "Hurriedly digging out names she’d stored for winter under a Moreton Bay Fig, she runs after him, pushing past the couples huddled together awaiting the tropical downpour that’s started to descend not far north of Launceston.",
  "Very often, when I think of myself writing, I have in my mind an image of a man at a table in a workshop, in a small pool of light.",
  "He may be making a shoe, he may be repairing a watch, he may be an artist, or an artist’s artisan, working on an engraving.",
  "What precisely he is doing does not matter very much, because in my mind he is also, as he cuts a sliver of leather, slips a small cog into place, or cross-hatches a tiny area of shadow, a writer, carefully choosing the words, shaping the phrases, paring his thoughts to their elements, saying, over and over, what lines he has in the hope that one of them will run on, will spill over into something he has not yet imagined— now and again reaching, where a shoemaker might reach for an awl or a watchmaker for a tiny spring, into a small tool-cabinet on the table beside him, for a piece of sheepsong or the end of a shower of rain, the shadow of an owl.",
  "When death comes I want to mistake it at first for an old friend whose name I have forgotten but will remember in a moment or two.",
  "When death comes like a large black cat out of the bush somewhere near Daylesford, padding up to me on the forest path, I do not want to go down on my knees before it, its paws on my shoulders, its meaty breath in my face.",
  "When death comes with its lesson I will be its inevitable pupil for the lesson is a beautiful one and I will never have time to learn it.",
  "When death comes with his ukulele and his picnic rug I will be curious about where he might take me.",
  "When death opens that door to me, I will want to know what Mary, after all, made of her cottage of darkness.",
  "Does she live there now at a desk, writing poems about eternity?",
  "I would like to read them from the inside out.",
  "The small pup, so small it is still shaped vaguely like an embryo and seems to be boneless, pushes its soft snout against your ankle as you cross the road.",
  "It makes a pleading sound.",
  "You know it is asking for its life.",
  "You find a tap and turn it on and hope the dog will drink from it.",
  "It chases your ankles, whining, calling, bleating, begging, asking for its life.",
  "You shout at it and it shows no understanding of your tone of voice, your intention, your distress, your approaching accusation.",
  "It moves along behind you, then it drifts away to another pair of ankles passing on the dusty road.",
  "This will not be enough, but there is nothing else to do.",
  "It is as if you are stuck in a dream with a dreamed dog that will never actually die but will always be dying up against your hard ankles.",
  "Your distant heart pacing away.",
  "You imagine picking up the pup and carrying it home and making a home with it, but you have no home.",
  "You are leaving this place very soon.",
  "The dog must be forgotten as quickly as possible.",
  "Inside you is a world where lives come and go like days, like wrappers, like novels, like meals, like buses, like birds, like seasons, like you.",
  "What is love without indifference, you say to yourself.",
  "My blood pumping in my clockwork body.",
  "Alive and throbbing.",
  "Focus leaves my eyes.",
  "I move to the telephone or somewhere else.",
  "No mistakes today.",
  "None left to make.",
  "Something about your mauve t-shirt moves me.",
  "Next we’ll say and say it well—‘it’s light, it’s lovely, it’s laminex’.",
  "New table, new colour.",
  "A type of sunny occasion.",
  "Everything pale and fading.",
  "Ice in lemonade, glass, underwater, pure pale blue.",
  "Breezes from the sea passing into the city like sadness.",
  "She put the glass down on the small table beside her and said I have begun to stop caring about her.",
  "She had not spoken this way before.",
  "She had been afraid.",
  "Her feelings were drifting, slipping away from their object and she had taken the photographs and put them away in a drawer.",
  "In one photograph there was a road.",
  "A grey road.",
  "A yellow sky.",
  "A black dog near a fence.",
  "A small dog against a small fence and a person, a figure— you couldn’t tell whether the figure was a woman or a man.",
  "The figure was walking on the road.",
  "A tiny figure.",
  "She had said that there was so much beauty in it and that it went beyond the sentimental.",
  "A photograph of her lover at the wheel of a car.",
  "Through the windscreen a man in a white shirt and grey trousers walked across a concrete square in front of an institution.",
  "She was saying It’s strange, when it’s over, the way you miss a person’s work almost as much as you miss that person.",
  "Pen-sickness: when you remember the poem waiting, perhaps liquid and infinitely yielding to each touch, or leaning back, resistant, towards its original spare shape, or dense and featureless as ice: then every gesture the world has made in it, every evening perception, every sip of speech, every word, comes back as bile, running precipitate into the throat hot as gruel from the long canals of the belly: in your own body, as in your language, there is something wanting to refuse you: you have proved your words indigestible: what was to have been the equable completed form takes on the thin consistency of vomit: you look at the paper with retching eyes.",
  "You are reminded, are you, of what it means to finish, to be finished, to be sent forth, homeless, your occupation gone, your promise lapsed into success: close your eyes, and you may glimpse the poem there, in the head, stirring, just outside reach, perfect and intolerable as that heaven that loured above us in our infancy.",
  "You hold your hands to the window, to the light of a new day, looking for changes, clues, in those lines that tremble across your palms like withering expectations like dribbling streams in a drought.",
  "You want to be your own scholar your own cassandra.",
  "You want to reject all the chiromantic texts, but the lines have a stubborn reticence and no magnifying glass will conjure up the lines of your future concealed under the first maybe second layer of skin: tiny, intricate, defined.",
  "Like a silicon chip.",
  "You try drawing out the signs in more domestic ways: palms in front of the heater, palms in front of a rotating fan, palms under the lunar glow of bedside, armchair lamplight.",

  "It seemed Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, Wrong as a divagation to Peking, To him that postulated as his theme The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, A passionately niggling nightingale.",
  "Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, A minor meeting, facile, delicate.",
  "Thus he conceived his voyaging to be An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, A sally into gold and crimson forms, As on this voyage, out of goblinry, And then retirement like a turning back And sinking down to the indulgences That in the moonlight have their habitude.",
  "But let these backward lapses, if they would, Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew It was a flourishing tropic he required For his refreshment, an abundant zone, Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious Yet with a harmony not rarefied Nor fined for the inhibited instruments Of over-civil stops.",
